# Deployment

pheasant is packaged as one container image and can run locally, with Docker Compose, in Docker Desktop Kubernetes, or in enterprise Kubernetes.

## Local Docker

The blank-canvas path needs no config file:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 \
  -v "$HOME/projects:/workspace" \
  -v pheasant-state:/state \
  ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant:<pyproject-version>
```

Generate a custom config through the live schema when required:

```bash
pheasant setup --target docker --output pheasant.yaml
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 \
  -v "$PWD/pheasant.yaml:/config/pheasant.yaml:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/projects:/workspace" \
  -v pheasant-state:/state \
  ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant:<pyproject-version>
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
cp deploy/compose/.env.example .env
docker compose --env-file .env \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

The repository Compose manifests live under `deploy/compose/`. The standard
stack serves API, MCP and the bundled UI together on `:8765`; the advanced and
fleet profiles are described in `deploy/compose/README.md`.
Step-by-step UI instructions, including the non-Docker path, live in
[Run the web UI](how-to/run-the-ui.md).

The profiles use these stable container paths:

| Host value | Container path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| generated or volume-backed config | `/config/pheasant.yaml` | Runtime config. |
| `PHEASANT_WORKSPACE_PATH` or named volume | `/workspace` | Indexed repositories and documents. |
| `pheasant-state` volume | `/state` | SQLite, manifests, graph snapshots and vectors. |
| `pheasant-memory` volume | `/memory` | Durable agent-memory records. |
| `pheasant-exports` volume | `/exports` | Regenerable exports. |

### Connecting local files that aren't in the workspace

A source can only index a path the container can actually see. **A host directory
that is not a subdirectory of the mounted workspace does not exist inside the
container** — registering a source for it fails with `path_missing` (the sync
result names the absent path and reminds you to mount it).

Set the workspace bind before starting Compose:

```bash
# ~/research appears in the container at /workspace.
PHEASANT_WORKSPACE_PATH="$HOME/research" docker compose --env-file .env \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Need more than one directory? Add mounts in an explicit override file
and add each *container* path to `security.allow_workspace_roots`:

```yaml
# deploy/compose/docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  pheasant:
    volumes:
      - /abs/host/notes:/notes:ro
      - /abs/host/archive:/archive:ro
```

Pass both manifests explicitly:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

A relative source `path` (for example `docs`) is anchored to `workspace_root`,
so it means `/workspace/docs`, not a path relative to the process directory.
Use absolute container paths such as `/notes` for additional mounts.

Check the API container:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/health
curl http://localhost:8765/ready
```

## MCP server inside Docker

For the primary VS Code workflow, start pheasant with Compose and let VS Code attach to a foreground stdio MCP process inside the running container:

```bash
pheasant compose-env pheasant.yaml --output .pheasant/compose.env
docker compose --env-file .pheasant/compose.env \
  -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker exec -i pheasant python -m pheasant mcp --config /config/pheasant.yaml --transport stdio
```

That command is normally launched by `.vscode/mcp.json`, not by hand. It must stay in the foreground because stdio is the transport.

To generate the VS Code config:

```bash
pheasant client-config vscode --output .vscode/mcp.json
```

If the local CLI is not installed, copy `examples/vscode/mcp.json` to `.vscode/mcp.json`.

For a one-off MCP-only container, use the generated Docker-run profile:

```bash
pheasant client-config vscode --mode docker-run --output .vscode/mcp.json
```

## Kubernetes manifests

Apply the example namespace, ConfigMap, PVC, Deployment, and Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```

The manifests assume one instance per namespace and one PVC-backed `/state` volume.

## Helm skeleton

```bash
helm template pheasant deploy/helm --namespace pheasant
helm install pheasant deploy/helm --namespace pheasant --create-namespace
```

The plain Kubernetes manifests and Helm defaults pin the current `pyproject.toml` version. Override the Helm image with `--set image.repository=... --set image.tag=...` when installing from a fork or a different release.

## CI and container registry

Validation and publishing are intentionally split across workflows.

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs ruff correctness lint, dependency checks, source compilation, pytest on Python 3.11 and 3.12, package build, Docker Compose validation, Docker image build, and image smoke tests.
- `.github/workflows/release-version.yml`: runs from trusted base-branch code, comments on PRs with valid release increments, and defaults to `patch` / `3` unless a maintainer comments with `minor`, `major`, `2`, or `1`.
- `.github/workflows/container.yml`: publishes after CI passes on a push to `main`. It resolves the release increment from **every commit since the last `chore: release`**, not just the PR that merged last — a merge that a red CI left unpublished still ships in the next image, so a `minor` it asked for is not demoted to the `patch` the latest PR asked for. It then applies the new version to `pyproject.toml` and every generated deployment reference, builds and pushes the images, reads the tags back from the registry, and only then commits the version to `main`. That order is deliberate — the release commit pins the version into files people apply directly, so it must not run ahead of a push that could fail. The reverse failure is recoverable: an image published without its commit is skipped, because the next release increments from whichever is higher, `pyproject.toml` or the highest published tag.
- A merge whose CI fails publishes nothing, and the workflow **fails rather than skipping**, naming the commit that is live in `main` with no matching image. The next green merge covers it: it publishes `main`'s head and its increment spans both commits.
- Merged PR to `main`: publishes `ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant:<pyproject version>` plus `:latest`, and from the same commit the web UI sidecar as `ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant-ui:<pyproject version>` plus `:latest`. The shared version tag is what lets compose files pin the API and UI together; `latest` is what makes the untagged `docker run ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant` in the README resolve. Generated files pin the version tag — nothing this repo writes depends on `latest`. Direct pushes to `main` are not releaseable because there is no PR release-increment comment to read.
- The workflow uses repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions with `packages: write`.

For public local installs, make the package public from the GitHub package settings after the first image is published — **both** packages, `pheasant` and `pheasant-ui`, or the UI sidecar fails to pull for anyone who is not authenticated to the registry. To block merges without validation and a checked release increment, require the CI checks and the `Release version selection` status in branch protection for `main`.

## Version alignment

`pyproject.toml` is the single source for the released semver. For local maintenance you can run `python scripts/sync_version.py --bump patch`, `--bump minor`, `--bump major`, or `--set 1.2.3` to update it and refresh generated deployment defaults. For PR releases, `patch` is selected by default; comment with a different release increment to override it and let the publish workflow update `main` before building the container.

`--check` fails when any generated reference has drifted; `--write` fixes them; `--list-paths` prints every file the script rewrites, which is exactly what the publish workflow stages in the release commit. The managed set covers `pyproject.toml`, the Helm chart and values, every Kubernetes manifest that names an image, the Compose manifests and environment example under `deploy/compose/` — if you add a file that pins `ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant`, add it to `replacements()` in the same change or `tests/test_version_alignment.py` will fail.

## Probes and ports

- API/UI port: `8765`
- Liveness: `GET /health`
- Readiness: `GET /ready`
- Metrics: `GET /metrics`

## Storage guidance

Do not share one writable `/state` volume across independent pheasant instances. Use separate namespaces/PVCs or an explicit future coordination mode.
