# How big can one region get?

Every scaling decision in pheasant comes back to one number: **how many nodes
the knowledge graph has**. The graph is held in memory during a sync and
written out as one compressed blob, so it sets the container's RAM, the time
each checkpoint costs, and how long a restart takes before it can serve.

The numbers below are **measured, not modelled** — `python -m
pheasant.graph.capacity` builds a real `SimpleMultiDiGraph` with realistic
attribute payloads at each scale and reports what it cost. Re-run it on your
own hardware; the shape will hold, the constants will move.

## Measured cost

Four scale points, on one container. Node and edge counts come from the ratio a
real corpus produces (~6.3 nodes and ~6.3 edges per file, taken from the live
2,132-file demo corpus at 13,503 nodes / 13,502 edges).

| Corpus | Nodes | Process RSS | Checkpoint write | Restart load | Edge scan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,000 files | 12.6k | **34 MB** | 0.13 s | 0.10 s | 1.8 ms |
| 20,000 files | 126k | **314 MB** | 1.3 s | 0.9 s | 16 ms |
| 100,000 files | 630k | **1.5 GB** | 6.7 s | 4.6 s | 95 ms |
| 250,000 files | 1.58M | **4.3 GB** | 19.9 s | 11.2 s | 240 ms |

Cost per node is flat across all four (~2.4 KB of RSS), so this is linear and
you can interpolate. Do **not** extrapolate far past the top row: a linear
projection to 250k files predicted 3.8 GB and the measured answer was 4.3 GB,
12% high.

## Sizing a region

| Corpus | Give the container | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| < 5,000 files | 512 MB, 1 CPU | |
| 5,000–25,000 | 1 GB, 2 CPU | |
| 25,000–75,000 | 2 GB, 2–4 CPU | |
| 75,000–150,000 | 4 GB, 4 CPU | |
| 150,000–240,000 | **6 GB, 4 CPU** | The shipped default. |
| 240,000–500,000 | 8–16 GB | Fine in the cloud; `graph.max_nodes` warns. |
| **> 500,000** | **Shard** | One container stops being sensible. |

These are per **region**, and linear — a cloud deployment can go well past the
bottom row on a single node. Sharding is about operational sanity (parallel
indexing, independent re-indexes, blast radius) more than about a hard wall.

!!! note "The shipped Kubernetes manifest allows 6 GB"

    `deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml` and the Helm chart limit memory to
    **6 Gi**, which covers roughly **350,000 files** on the table above. It was
    1 Gi (about 65,000 files) until 2026-08-16; a corpus past that was
    OOM-killed mid-sync and it presented as an unexplained restart rather than
    as a capacity problem. Raise it further for a cloud deployment — the
    numbers above are per-region and linear.

## How long the first index takes

Measured by `python -m pheasant.sync.benchmark --mode capacity`, one worker,
embeddings off, on uniform markdown:

| Corpus | Time | Files/s | /state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 500 files | 1.4 s | 356 | 3 MB |
| 1,000 | 2.9 s | 345 | 5 MB |
| 2,000 | 5.8 s | 344 | 11 MB |
| 4,000 | 12.3 s | 326 | 87 MB |
| 8,000 | 26.2 s | 305 | 173 MB |

**Linear** — each doubling of the corpus roughly doubles the time (measured
2.06x, 2.01x, 2.12x, 2.13x). So `files ÷ 300` is a usable first estimate in
seconds, and `pheasant scan` does that arithmetic for you.

!!! warning "This was superlinear until 2026-08-16"

    The same sweep on the previous release went 1.9 s → 164.7 s over the same
    range — **tripling** for every doubling, an ~O(n^1.7) curve that
    extrapolated to about 16 hours at 250,000 files.

    The cause: `chunks_fts.artifact_id` is an UNINDEXED FTS5 column, so the
    per-artifact `DELETE FROM chunks_fts WHERE artifact_id=?` was a full scan
    of a table growing with the corpus — and on a *full* sync it was scanning
    to delete nothing, because the source had already been emptied before the
    loop. Skipping a question whose answer is already known made an
    8,000-file index **6.3x** faster.

    If you have an older recorded timing, discard it. A per-file figure taken
    from a small corpus and multiplied up was extrapolating a curve as though
    it were a line.

    **SQLite only.** The Postgres backend never had this: `chunks_fts` there
    is an ordinary table with `idx_chunks_fts_artifact`, so the delete was
    always indexed. If you were already on Postgres, the times above are the
    ones you had.

**Disk** tracks *content*, not file count: measured at **~4.0 bytes of
`/state` per corpus byte**, flat to within 3% across the sweep, and dominated
by SQLite storing every chunk's text again plus its FTS index. Embeddings add
`chunks × dimensions × 4` bytes on top.

**Embedding time is not projected.** A network embedder's throughput is the
provider's rate limit, not pheasant's — the 2026-08-12 vscode run measured
~20 files/min against a real endpoint, two orders of magnitude below the
offline figures above, and that number describes the provider. Benchmark your
own, and note that the [worker fleet](worker-fleet.md) does not help here:
embedding is a network wait, not CPU.

## Checkpoint cost, and why it is no longer the ceiling

A checkpoint serializes the entire graph, so its cost grows with the index. The
interval is **derived from that cost**, not fixed — pheasant uses Young's
formula (`T = sqrt(2 x C x MTBF)`), the standard HPC/ML-training result, which
minimizes the *sum* of checkpoint overhead and work redone after a crash rather
than either alone:

| Corpus | Checkpoint cost | Interval | Overhead | Worst-case rework |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,000 files | 0.13 s | 150 s | 0.1% | 2.5 min |
| 20,000 files | 1.3 s | 8 min | 0.3% | 8 min |
| 100,000 files | 6.7 s | 18 min | 0.6% | 18 min |
| 250,000 files | 19.9 s | 31 min | 1.1% | 31 min |

Overhead stays around 1% at every size. The trade is bounded rework — at most
one interval of indexing is lost to a crash — capped by
`storage.graph_checkpoint_max_seconds` (30 min).

```yaml
storage:
  checkpoint_mtbf_seconds: 86400      # expected time between interruptions
  graph_checkpoint_max_seconds: 1800  # ceiling on lost work
```

Lower `checkpoint_mtbf_seconds` on spot or preemptible instances: interruptions
are more frequent there, and the formula responds by checkpointing more often —
which is exactly when that pays for itself.

So checkpoint cost is **not** what limits one region. RAM is, and it grows
linearly — the table at the top is the guide.

pheasant warns once per sync when the graph passes `graph.max_nodes` (default
**1.5M nodes**, ≈240,000 files — the point at which the shipped 6 Gi container
is genuinely full). It is a notice, not a refusal: by the time it can fire the
index already exists, and discarding it would help nobody. Raise it *and* the
container limit together, or shard.

```yaml
graph:
  max_nodes: 1500000   # null disables the warning
```

## When to separate graph queries from API replicas

The fleet profile can put the resident graph behind an authenticated internal
service:

```yaml
graph:
  query_service_url: http://graph:8765
  query_service_token_env: PHEASANT_GRAPH_SERVICE_TOKEN
  query_service_timeout_seconds: 30
```

The `graph` role loads and refreshes the snapshot; API/MCP replicas keep only a
bounded proxy. This is worth the extra network hop and service when either:

* API graph residency is regularly above roughly **60-70% of a 3 GiB limit**;
* two or more API replicas would otherwise duplicate a large graph; or
* graph-query CPU/latency needs to scale independently from text/vector/API
  traffic.

It does **not** make graph enrichment or snapshot saves faster: those remain in
the single commit authority. If save/enrichment dominates an indexing run,
split sources into multiple knowledge-base shards below so each indexer and
graph service owns a smaller snapshot. For one API below the memory threshold,
the default local graph is simpler, uses less total fleet memory, and avoids the
HTTP hop. There is no automatic local fallback in remote mode because an outage
must not cause every API replica to materialize the graph simultaneously.

## When you cross the line: shard

Split the corpus across several pheasant regions and let the
[Synapse router](attach-to-synapse.md) fan out across them. Each region is an
ordinary container with its own `/state`, so:

* memory and checkpoint cost divide by the number of shards, and both are the
  constraints above;
* regions index **in parallel**, so wall-clock time to first index divides too;
* a region can be re-indexed or replaced without touching the others.

Shard along a boundary that matches how people search — per repository, per
team, per document collection — rather than by hashing paths. Retrieval quality
depends on related content living in the same graph: splitting one repository
across two regions breaks the cross-source edges that make
`get_graph_neighbors` useful, while splitting *between* repositories costs
nothing, because those edges were never going to exist.

Sizing a fleet is the single-region table divided by the shard count. 600,000
files across 6 regions is six containers of the 100,000-file row — 1.5 GB and a
6.7 s checkpoint each — indexing in parallel, instead of one 10 GB container
indexing serially.

### Let pheasant propose the split

```bash
pheasant shard plan -c pheasant.yaml            # fewest regions that fit
pheasant shard plan -c pheasant.yaml --shards 4 # exactly four
```

It scans each source (a directory walk, not an index), packs whole sources
largest-first, and prints which sources go where with a memory request per
region:

```text
600,000 files across 3 region(s) (~3,780,000 graph nodes)

  shard-1: 220,000 files, ~1,386,000 nodes, ~5.5 GB RSS -> request 8Gi
      - platform-monorepo
  shard-2: 200,000 files, ~1,260,000 nodes, ~5.0 GB RSS -> request 8Gi
      - docs-site
      - runbooks
```

The count defaults to the fewest regions that keep every shard under
`graph.max_nodes`, so the planner and the runtime warning agree about what "too
big" means. A single source over budget on its own is reported rather than
split — no arrangement of whole sources fixes that, and the honest answers are
more memory for that region or a narrower `include`/`exclude`.

### One commit authority per knowledge-base shard

Postgres allows API replicas and durable coordination, but the persisted graph
is one whole-file snapshot and its node FTS is one global projection. Several
indexers committing different sources from stale graph snapshots can overwrite
one another even when relational rows are source-scoped. Pheasant therefore
elects one indexer to own watcher, scheduler, queue drain and graph commits per
shard. Extra indexers are hot standbys. Parallelism stays in multi-source
preparation inside that authority and in the stateless worker tier.

## Which storage backend

Independent of the graph, and a different question:

| | SQLite (default) | Postgres |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | none | a database to run |
| Writers | **one process per knowledge base** | **one elected indexer per shard**, with standby failover |
| Read replicas | one container | many |
| Ranking | BM25 | see [configuration](../configuration.md#where-state-lives-storagebackend) |

Use SQLite unless you need several replicas serving one knowledge base,
database-backed leader election, or a durable broker-backed fleet. It is not
slower for a single container, and it is one fewer thing to operate. Postgres
does **not** change the graph numbers above, because the graph is held in memory
either way.

## Ask pheasant instead of reading the table

`pheasant scan` walks a source without reading it, so every number above can
be projected **before** you commit to a first index — which is the moment it
is useful, rather than after an OOM kill:

```console
$ pheasant scan -c pheasant.yaml
platform-monorepo (/workspace/platform)
  would index 6000 files, 27.93 MB (scanned 6003 entries, pruned 0 directories)
  largest subtrees: services (13 MB), web (9 MB), docs (4 MB)
  within configured limits — sync would proceed
  projected: ~37,800 nodes, ~0.1 GB RAM, ~0.1 GB in /state, ~19.8s to index
  suggested container memory: 0.5Gi
```

The projection reflects *your* config — enabling embeddings adds the vector
store to the disk figure — and warns when a corpus needs sharding rather than
a bigger container. `--json` includes it as a `projection` object.

## Sizing the evaluation plane

`evaluation` scales on a **different axis** from the corpus: cohort size times
the ablation matrix, not file count. A region with a million files and forty
recorded queries has a large index and a trivial evaluation, and the reverse is
equally possible — so one "how big should this be" number would describe
neither, and `scan` reports it separately when evaluation is enabled:

```console
evaluation plane (region-wide)
  at full cohorts (200 queries x 6 variants x 6 cohorts): 7,200 replays/run, ~1.0 min
  storage: ~47 MB per run (~17.1 GB/yr at the configured cadence), 5.8 MB of replay
           checkpoints in flight
  suggested container memory for a batch: 0.5Gi
```

Three numbers, three different questions:

| Number | What it is | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| **replays/run, minutes** | `queries × variants × cohorts` real searches | Whether a batch fits `maximum_runtime_seconds` |
| **MB per run / GB per year** | Metric rows and reports, which accumulate | How big the `/state` volume must be |
| **checkpoint MB in flight** | Replay checkpoints, deleted when the run completes | How much the volume must have **free** during a run |

The steady-state figure is an **upper bound**: per-query metric rows exist only
for queries carrying positive proof, so a region where a quarter of queries are
evidenced — the ordinary case — uses roughly a quarter of it. The bound points
that way deliberately; over-provisioning a volume is cheap and running out
mid-run is not.

### Levers, in order of effect

1. `evaluation.cohorts.maximum_queries_per_cohort` — linear in everything.
2. `evaluation.maximum_stored_per_query_results` — the per-query audit rows are
   most of the steady state.
3. `evaluation.minimum_interval_seconds`, or leaving `on_material_snapshot`
   off — a region indexing hourly will otherwise evaluate hourly.
4. Trimming `evaluation.variants` — `B0` is not removable, because every
   attribution number is a paired difference against it.

Adding workers is **not** a lever:
[replay is deliberately not distributed](../knowledge-effectiveness.md#why-replay-is-not-fanned-out-over-the-worker-transport).
Past the point where a batch will not fit a budget worth having, the answer is
`pheasant shard plan` — each shard then evaluates itself.

### Measure it here

```bash
python -m pheasant.evaluation.benchmark --output evaluation-capacity.json
```

Runs a real batch through the real search path and prints what it measured
beside what the model projected. CI runs it on every change to the plane and
publishes the comparison as a job summary — because a model nobody checks
against a machine is a model that quietly stops describing anything. The first
two coefficients shipped here were out by 2x (time) and 3x (peak volume), and
this is how that was found.

## Sizing a fleet

Past one container, the shape is
[four tiers](worker-fleet.md#running-the-whole-fleet). What the file count
predicts:

| Corpus | Shards | Indexers | Graph services | API replicas | Workers | Graph/index memory each |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| < 25,000 | 1 | 1 | — local | — single container | 0 | 0.5–1 Gi |
| 75,000 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 Gi |
| 150,000 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 2 Gi |
| 250,000 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 16 | 4 Gi |
| 600,000 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 24 | 8 Gi |

Two of those columns are honest guesses and it is worth saying which:
**api replicas** track request traffic, which a file count cannot predict —
two is a floor so a rollout is not an outage. **Workers** are one per ~25,000
files per shard, capped at 8, because the 2026-08-13 benchmark measured 8 file
workers buying only 1.113x on a commit-dominated fixture; the tier helps when
parsing is expensive (PDFs, large documents), not uniformly.

Only **shards** and **memory** come straight from measurement.

Keep the scaling scopes separate:

| Constraint observed | Scale | Do not scale |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP/MCP request saturation | API replicas | indexers |
| Graph-query latency/CPU | Graph replicas, preferably across nodes | workers |
| Parse/extraction backlog | Stateless workers | graph replicas |
| Graph save, enrichment, or ordered commit | Whole knowledge-base shards | indexer replicas within one shard |
| Embedding 429s/provider latency | Provider quota or lower embedding concurrency | preparation workers |

Docker Compose shares one host, so extra replicas can compete for the same CPU
and database; the shipped default stays at one graph service, one active
indexer, and four workers. Kubernetes makes API, graph, and worker scaling
independent, but one namespace/release should still describe one shard. Give
each shard its own name, database scope, NATS durable/subject, RWX state, and
tokens, then fan retrieval across shards rather than sharing a writable graph.

## Request concurrency and the thread pool

The table above sizes **api replicas** for traffic, but not the budget those
replicas actually enforce it with. `server.api.max_concurrent_requests`
(`docs/configuration.md`'s "Serving durability" section) bounds how many
requests the shedding middleware admits at once before answering 429. Every
sync HTTP route in this process — which is most of them — and every MCP tool
call made against the `/mcp` mount in the same process run on a *separate*
budget: anyio's shared worker-thread pool, 40 tokens by default. On startup,
if `max_concurrent_requests` is set, this process raises that pool's token
count to at least match it, so admitting a request the limiter is happy with
never means it silently queues for a thread instead. Size
`max_concurrent_requests` for HTTP *and* MCP traffic combined, not HTTP
alone, since both draw from the one pool. `GET /metrics`'s
`pheasant_threadpool_tokens_total` / `_tokens_available` show the pool's
current headroom next to `pheasant_requests_inflight`.

This is a fixed invariant, not a measured coefficient like the numbers
above it — it does not live in `src/pheasant/capacity.py`.

## Measure your own

```bash
python -m pheasant.sync.benchmark --mode capacity --sizes 500,2000,8000
python -m pheasant.graph.capacity --files 2000,20000,100000
python -m pheasant.sync.benchmark --workers 1,2,4,8
```

The first is what produced the tables above; it prints its own coefficients
beside the measurements so drift is visible. Its fixture is uniform markdown,
which is the caveat that matters most: a real corpus of PDFs or code moves
seconds-per-file a long way and nodes-per-file hardly at all. That is also why
the model's `nodes_per_file` comes from a **live** 2,132-file corpus (6.3) and
not from the synthetic sweep (3.0) — the fixture has no links, headings or
symbols, so adopting its figure would have halved every memory projection.
