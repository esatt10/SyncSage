# The universal pheasant image: API + MCP + web UI, one container, one port.
#
# Two things make it "universal", and both are deliberate:
#
# 1. **Every optional code path is installed.** PHEASANT_EXTRAS defaults to all
#    of them, so any config a user writes actually works — semantic search
#    (lancedb), the agentic answer loop (langgraph), sandboxed connectors
#    (wasmtime), signed contracts (cryptography), and the Phase-35 scale-out
#    backends — Postgres state (psycopg), the gRPC worker transport and the
#    NATS index queue. The scaled manifests under deploy/kubernetes/scaled/
#    select all three, so leaving them out shipped an image that could not run
#    the topology this repo publishes. The old default of "mcp"
#    meant a perfectly valid pheasant.yaml could fail at runtime in the
#    published image with a missing-extra error, which is a bad trade for an
#    image size nobody was optimising anyway. Slim builds are still one flag:
#      docker build --build-arg PHEASANT_EXTRAS=mcp .
#
# 2. **The UI is baked in and served by the API itself.** No sidecar, no nginx,
#    no second port to publish and no CORS origin to get right. The separate
#    ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant-ui image still exists for deployments that want
#    to scale or cache the static bundle independently.
#
# So the zero-config path is genuinely one line:
#   docker run -p 8765:8765 -v "$PWD:/workspace:ro" -v pheasant-state:/state \
#     ghcr.io/esatt10/pheasant

# Run as an unprivileged user. The indexer reads whatever paths it is pointed
# at, so running it as root means a misconfigured source — or a bug in the
# path handling — reads the container's entire filesystem, /proc/self/environ
# (which holds any API keys passed through `environment:`) included. The state
# and export volumes are chowned so the non-root user can still write them;
# source mounts stay read-only and only need read access.
#
# /config is writable by design: with no config bind-mounted, the entrypoint
# generates one there on first boot. A read-only bind mount still wins — the
# entrypoint only writes when the file is absent.
