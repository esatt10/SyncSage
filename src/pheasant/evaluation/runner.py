"""The batch: resolve, replay, measure, gate, explain, decide, persist.

This is the specification's fourteen-step process in one place, and the order
is not arbitrary -- gates are evaluated before aggregation so a failure cannot
be averaged away, and candidate decisions come after gates so a proposal cannot
be promoted out of a run that failed one.

Four things make it safe to run in a fleet, which is the deployment this
region is built for.

**One run per state directory, enforced by a lease.** Several API replicas
pointed at one ``/state`` would otherwise each replay the whole cohort and each
write a run row. :data:`EVALUATION_LEASE` is claimed through the existing
:class:`~pheasant.sync.locks.SourceLease` -- a single conditional ``UPDATE``
that the database arbitrates, already proven against a real Postgres server --
so a second process finds the lease held and declines rather than duplicating
the work. A replica that dies mid-run stops heartbeating and the lease goes
stale, which is exactly the recovery an indexer already gets.

**It never takes ``sync_lock``.** The scheduler holds that across all its work,
and a thousand-query replay inside it would stall incremental sync for every
source in the region. This is the same mistake the observation plane's
hot-to-cold Parquet roll was deliberately moved outside the lock to avoid, and
it is worth restating because the pull toward "just put it on the beat" is
strong: the beat *triggers* a run, the run does not run *inside* the beat's
lock.

**The work is read-only and bounded.** Replay issues searches and nothing else;
usage tracking is off on the replay searcher so a measured retrieval cannot
inflate the salience of the record it measured. A run is capped by
``maximum_queries_per_run`` and ``maximum_runtime_seconds``, and a truncated run
says which queries it dropped rather than reporting a smaller denominator as if
it were the whole cohort.

**Roles.** ``--role api`` replicas serve requests and must not spend their
budget replaying cohorts, so an automatic trigger fires only where the scheduler
runs (``all`` and ``indexer``); every role can still start one on request,
because an operator asking for a report is not background work.

**Replay is deliberately not fanned out over the worker transport.** The fleet
has one (``sync.concurrency.worker_transport``, HTTP or gRPC), and it carries
*preparation* -- which is an optimization, so a failed hop falls back to local
preparation and the sync produces the same thing either way. Replay has the
opposite contract: it is a measurement, and one that fell back to a different
execution path would be measuring the fallback. Distributing a cohort would also
introduce the two things a reproducible run cannot have -- per-worker variation
in what the index holds at the moment each query runs, and a result whose
composition depends on which worker answered. A batch runs in one process
against one snapshot; scale here is fewer queries or a longer interval, and a
region past that is one ``pheasant shard plan`` should be splitting.
