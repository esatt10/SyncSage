"""Shadow validation: a proposal earns production ranking or it does not get it.

The state machine is the specification's::

    observed evidence -> proposed -> candidate -> shadow validated -> active
                                                 -> retained | rejected

and the load-bearing edge is the one from *candidate* to *active*. Everything
before it already exists in this codebase: ``memory.formation`` mines the
observation plane and writes rows to ``memory_candidates``, which a person
promotes from the Memory tab. What was missing is the evidence a promotion
decision could be made *on*, and the guarantee that gathering it cannot itself
change what production returns.

Both are here.

**A candidate never touches the store to be measured.** Shadow rules are passed
into the search call per query and live for its duration --
``ReplayEngine`` hands them to ``search_context`` as ``extra_steering_records``,
which routes them through the same ``parse_rule``/``admits`` path a stored rule
takes. Nothing is written, so a candidate cannot reach production ranking by
being evaluated.

**Promotion on originating-query performance alone is refused.** A candidate
that improves the query that created it has demonstrated recall of its own
evidence. That is the self-rewarding loop, and
``allow_originating_query_only_promotion`` is off by default so it stays
closed: the decision needs independent queries, and -- when generalization is
required -- a temporal holdout the candidate could not have been fitted to.

**A proposed *fact* is not shadow-replayable, and says so.** Its text is not in
any index, so no arm can return it; scoring the candidate's own text against
the query would measure string similarity and report it as retrieval. Those
candidates come back as ``not_shadow_replayable`` with that reason, which is a
smaller answer than the alternative and a true one.
