"""The baseline and ablation matrix.

An ablation result is valid only when the intervention is the *only* difference
between the paired runs. That sentence is the whole module: every variant here
names its baseline explicitly, and every variant differs from that baseline in
exactly one declared thing.

The default matrix is the specification's:

======  ==============  =====  ==========  =========  ==========================
Id      Memory results  Alias  Preference  Exclusion  What it isolates
======  ==============  =====  ==========  =========  ==========================
``B0``  off             no     no          no         the corpus alone
``B1``  auto            no     no          no         memory as *content*
``B2``  off             yes    no          no         vocabulary adaptation
``B3``  off             no     yes         no         preferred-source ranking
``B4``  off             no     no          yes        noise suppression
``B5``  auto            yes    yes         yes        the memory system entire
``B6``  auto            yes    yes         yes        B5 plus candidate shadow
======  ==============  =====  ==========  =========  ==========================

Two design notes worth stating where they will be read.

**B2-B4 hold memory content off.** A steering rule is measured by what it does
to *corpus* ranking, and running it with memory passages on would let a
retrieved memory record take a slot and get counted as the rule's doing. The
rule and the passage are separate interventions with separate rows.

**B6 is the only variant that can contain something not yet live**, and it is
never a production configuration -- shadow validation runs it, compares it to
B5, and a candidate reaches retrieval only if that comparison passes the gates.
A candidate that improved its own originating query and nothing else fails on
the holdout, which is the loop this exists to close.

Leave-one-out variants (per record, per cluster) are generated on demand rather
than enumerated, because their count is the store's size.
