"""Immutable manifests: what state was evaluated, exactly.

A snapshot is not a copy of the knowledge base. Copying a multi-million-chunk
corpus per evaluation run is not affordable and would not help: what a
comparison needs is the ability to say *whether two runs saw the same thing*,
and for that a digest is as good as the bytes and costs a scan instead of a
duplication.

So a manifest is a set of content digests over every input capable of changing
what retrieval returns. The completeness matters more than any single field.
Two runs are directly comparable only when the fields that differ between them
can be enumerated -- and a field nobody recorded cannot be enumerated, so an
uncaptured input becomes an unexplained metric change months later, which is
the failure this whole plane is built to avoid.

**Digests are computed the same way on every replica.** Every one of them is
an ordered, deterministic reduction over rows read in a fixed sort order, so
two API pods building a manifest for one state agree on its id without
coordinating. That is what makes ``save_snapshot``'s ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``
the right idempotency, and it is why nothing here reads a clock, a hostname,
or a process id.

**Aggregation happens in SQL, not in Python.** ``digest_of_query`` reduces with
a running hash over a streamed cursor rather than materializing ids into a
list. A corpus manifest over 400k artifacts is a real shape here, and the
evaluation plane must never be the thing that makes a region run out of memory.

**A partial manifest says so.** A digest the builder could not resolve is
recorded in ``incomplete`` rather than defaulted to an empty string. A run over
an incomplete snapshot is invalid by default (``incomplete_snapshot_blocks_run``),
which is only enforceable if incompleteness is representable.
