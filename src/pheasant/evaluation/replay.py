"""Deterministic batch replay: run the cohort through the real retrieval path.

Nothing here re-implements retrieval. Every result comes from
:meth:`pheasant.search.hybrid.HybridSearch.search_context` -- the same call the
HTTP and MCP surfaces make -- because a replay against a re-implementation
measures the re-implementation. That is not a hypothetical: this repository has
already lost time to a hand-rolled `yaml.py` that shadowed the real parser and
made the suite validate against something the image never ran.

Three properties the replay owes its callers.

**Paired by query id, not by position.** A variant that fails on one query must
not shift every later comparison by one. Results are keyed, and a query that
completed in one variant and failed in the other is excluded from the pair with
a recorded reason rather than compared against a hole.

**Read-only, and it writes nothing anywhere.** Usage tracking is off on the
replay searcher: counting a replayed retrieval as a *use* would let evaluation
inflate the salience of the records it is measuring, which is the tightest
self-rewarding loop this system could build. Shadow candidates are passed in
per call and never persisted.

**Over-fetch, then exclude.** Leave-one-out attribution removes a record's hits
from a result list the region really produced. Done naively that is a top-k with
a hole in it; done here the searcher is asked for ``k * OVERFETCH`` and the list
is truncated to ``k`` *after* exclusion, so the slots a held-out record occupied
are refilled from real ranked candidates. It is still an approximation of "the
record was never written" -- fusion scores are unchanged, and a hit that would
have entered from beyond the widened window does not -- and the report says so
rather than implying the exclusion was exact.
