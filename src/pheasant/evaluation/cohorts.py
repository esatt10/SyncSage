"""Query cohorts, and the leakage controls that make them mean anything.

A cohort is a set of queries evaluated together *for a stated purpose*, and the
purposes are not interchangeable. Two of them exist purely to stop a single
honest-looking mistake:

**Learned is not generalization.** Replaying the queries whose interactions
created a memory, and reporting the improvement as "the memory helped", measures
recall of the exact experience the memory was minted from. It will always look
excellent. The temporal holdout -- queries asked *after* the intervention
existed, which contributed none of its evidence -- is the one that can
disappoint, which is what makes it worth running. They are separate cohorts
with separate metrics and the report never merges them.

**Control is how you find out what you broke.** An alias rule that improves its
own queries and quietly re-ranks a hundred unrelated ones is a net loss that
every treatment-only metric will report as a win. The control cohort is queries
the intervention should not touch at all, and a change there is a regression by
definition rather than by threshold.

Beyond that: the **anchor** cohort is frozen and replayed at every snapshot, so
a trend line compares like with like; the **rolling** cohort is recent traffic,
which moves for two reasons at once (the region changed, and so did what people
ask) and therefore must never be reported alone; and the **synthetic invariant**
cohort is deterministic cases for ACL, validity, supersession and abstention --
system properties rather than user utility, which is why they are gates rather
than scores.

Every cohort here is derived from state the region already holds. Nothing asks
a human to label a corpus, which is the assumption the specification is written
against.
