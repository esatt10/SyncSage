"""Append-only persistence for the evaluation plane.

A thin, deliberate layer over :class:`~pheasant.persistence.state_store.StateStore`
rather than a second storage abstraction. Three properties it has to keep, each
of which has cost this codebase time somewhere else:

**Portable SQL only.** ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``, never
``INSERT OR IGNORE``; ``?`` placeholders that the backend translates. The
SQLite-only spelling is a bug this repository has already shipped and fixed
once, and it did not surface in the offline suite -- it surfaced against a
real Postgres server. Every statement here is written the portable way from
the start.

**Writes are idempotent because ids are content digests.** Re-running a batch
over an unchanged snapshot with unchanged configuration re-derives the same
run id and the same metric row ids, so a retried or duplicated run is a no-op
rather than a second copy of the same numbers. That is the reproducibility
acceptance criterion made mechanical instead of aspirational.

**Nothing here is ever deleted.** Retention is a policy applied by pruning old
*runs*, not by rewriting them: the specification's audit requirement is that an
aggregate resolve to the per-query operands that produced it, and an
after-the-fact edit breaks that for every report already published.
