"""Measure what an evaluation batch actually costs, and check the model against it.

`capacity.py` holds the coefficients that answer "how big should the evaluation
node and its volume be". This is the run that produces them, and the run that
notices when they have rotted.

Deterministic and fully offline: a seeded generator writes a synthetic corpus
and a synthetic ledger, then a **real** batch runs through the real search path
— no mocked retrieval anywhere, for the same reason
`pheasant.memory.benchmark` refuses to mock its own. A measurement taken
against a stand-in measures the stand-in.

What comes out is three things:

* **measured** — what this machine actually did: seconds, milliseconds per
  replay, bytes landed in ``/state``, peak checkpoint bytes.
* **projected** — what :func:`pheasant.capacity.project_evaluation` said it
  would do, for the same shape.
* **ladder** — the projection at production cohort sizes, which is the table an
  operator sizing a volume actually reads.

The comparison is the point. A model whose numbers nobody checks against a
machine is a model that quietly stops describing anything, and the specific
failure it guards is the one this repository has already shipped once: a
coefficient measured on a small corpus, extrapolated as a line, that was
actually a curve.

Reproduce with::

    python -m pheasant.evaluation.benchmark --output evaluation-capacity.json
