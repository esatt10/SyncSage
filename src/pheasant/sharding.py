"""Planning a shard split (Phase 35.4).

The capacity work measured where one region stops being sensible; this turns
that into a concrete proposal — *these sources go to region 1, those to region
2* — with the configs to run them.

**Shards are whole sources.** That is the load-bearing decision, and it is not
about implementation convenience. Retrieval quality depends on related content
living in one graph: `resolve_cross_source_edges` links an import or a Markdown
link to the file it names, and `get_graph_neighbors` walks those links. Splitting
one repository across two regions severs exactly the edges that make the graph
worth having, while splitting *between* repositories costs nothing, because
those edges were never going to exist.

Hashing paths across shards — the obvious mechanical answer, and the one the
plan originally called for — would do the opposite: it distributes evenly and
severs every edge. Even balance is the wrong objective when the thing being
balanced is a graph.

So this is bin-packing over sources, greedy largest-first, which is the classic
LPT heuristic and lands within 4/3 of optimal. Optimal packing is NP-hard and
the input is a size estimate, so a guaranteed-close answer from a
one-line-explainable rule beats an exact answer to the wrong question.
