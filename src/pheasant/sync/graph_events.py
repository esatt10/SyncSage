"""Announcing a graph commit, so a replica need not go looking (Phase 35.8).

The graph is a file on a shared volume. An indexer writes it; every serving
process polls for it and swaps generations atomically. That is
shared-storage integration between services — the coupling style the whole
microservice literature exists to discourage — and it carries three costs:
a ReadWriteMany requirement that rules out most default StorageClasses, a
window in which replicas disagree about what the region contains, and a
failure mode (a stale graph) that is silent by construction.

The storage question is a larger design decision and is not this module. The
*window* is, and it collapses to commit latency with one message on the broker
the topology already runs:

    indexer  --publish--> pheasant.graph.committed.<kb>  --> every replica
                                                             reloads at once

Three properties this deliberately has, each of which is why it is core NATS
rather than JetStream:

**Fan-out, not work-sharing.** Every replica must reload; a work queue would
hand the message to exactly one of them, which is the opposite. JetStream is
right for `index_tasks` — the task must be done once — and wrong here.

**At-most-once, on purpose.** A dropped notification costs one poll interval,
because the poll is *kept* as a backstop rather than replaced. So this needs
no durable consumer, no acks, no per-replica state in the broker, and no
cleanup when a pod goes away. A design that had to guarantee delivery would
have to own all four.

**Fail-soft in both directions.** A publish failure is logged and swallowed —
a commit that has already reached disk must not be undone by a broker being
down — and a region with no broker at all keeps the polling refresher it has
always had, unchanged. Rule 7: the no-infrastructure path is the default and
stays the default.

The payload is small and content-addressed: the generation id from the
publication record, its counts, and the knowledge base it belongs to. A
subscriber uses it as a *hint to look*, never as data — it re-reads the
record from `/state` before deciding anything, so a forged or stale message
can cost a wasted stat and nothing else.
