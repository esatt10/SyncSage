"""Interval-based catch-all incremental sync loop.

The scheduler is the fallback freshness mechanism for sources the
filesystem watcher cannot observe (web collections, APIs, S3): a daemon
thread calls ``SyncEngine.sync_all(mode="incremental")`` every
``sync.scheduler.interval_seconds``. It is a no-op when disabled in config.

Scheduler- and watcher-triggered syncs are serialized through a shared
``sync_lock`` because ``SyncEngine`` is not safe for concurrent syncs within
one process (full crash/concurrency safety lands in Step 21.2).
