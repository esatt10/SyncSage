"""Run a sync in a separate process, so indexing cannot starve serving.

Indexing is CPU-bound Python. In the server process that means the GIL: while
a sync runs, request threads barely get scheduled. Measured on a live index —
one model call took 0.57s idle and **107s** during a sync, and search latency
swung by 4x. Cooperative yielding (:mod:`pheasant.sync.pacing`) softened that;
it could not remove it, because the work and the serving still shared one
interpreter.

So the server does not index. It runs ``python -m pheasant sync`` as a child
process, which owns the CPU cost in its own interpreter, writes to ``/state``
the way any other client would, and reports its result on stdout. The parent
then reloads the graph from disk — cheap now that it is compressed — and keeps
serving throughout.

Nothing about correctness changes: the child takes the same single-writer
lease (:class:`~pheasant.sync.locks.EngineLease`) the in-process path took, so
two writers still cannot overlap. ``SyncEngine.sync_source`` remains the
in-process path, used by the CLI, the tests, and anyone embedding pheasant.
