"""The observation plane: what was asked, on which surface, by whom, and what
came back.

An **observation is not a memory record and must never become one.** A row here
is never a file, never chunked, never indexed, and never returned by a search --
a UI session's chat does not become knowledge because it was observed. The only
path from here into memory is a *candidate* that something admits, and admission
goes through :meth:`pheasant.memory.store.MemoryStore.append` like every other
write, so memory's first invariant ("records are files, no second ingestion
path") never bends. See ``docs/memory-formation.md``.

Three things in this module are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

**The request path does a bounded in-memory handoff and nothing else.** Writing
one row per request into the region's own database puts a write on the same
PostgreSQL the lexical search arm contends on, and ``docs/architecture.md``
names high-frequency PostgreSQL text ranking as the dominant measured search
bottleneck. Making that write fail-soft protects correctness and does nothing
for latency. So a request appends one dataclass to a bounded deque; a flusher
thread batches and hands the batch on.

**Under pressure this loses data, not latency.** The buffer is bounded and the
queue depth is bounded, and crossing either drops observations rather than
blocking or growing without limit -- the same posture ``bound_concurrency``
takes when it answers 429 under saturation. It has a real consequence worth
stating where someone will read it: every memory-formation threshold counts a
stream that is thinned under load, so a busy region forms memory *more slowly*,
not incorrectly.

**Trace and span ids exist with or without OpenTelemetry.** They are the event's
primary key, so they cannot be optional. Without the ``[otel]`` extra this module
mints W3C-shaped ids itself and the ledger works unchanged; with it, the ids come
from the real span context, so a row here and a span in the operator's collector
name the same call. That keeps CLAUDE.md rule 7 -- an infrastructure-free
pheasant is unaffected either way -- and it is why ``pytest`` stays network-free
by construction rather than by mocking: an exporter is attached only when
``observability.otlp_endpoint`` is set, and the default is ``None``.

    payload, whatever surface produced it.

    One implementation, two callers, on purpose. A formation rule that saw
    ids from MCP and paths from HTTP would mine different evidence depending
    on which surface a user happened to be on -- which is the opposite of the
    determinism every rule downstream of this is built on.

    Ids join to `graph_nodes` and, through them, to `chunks`, which is how a
    rule asks whether a retrieved document actually contains the token that
    found it. Paths are `relative_path`: the same grammar `steering` matches
    against, so a `preference` rule minted from these can actually fire.

    Shape-tolerant because the surfaces genuinely differ -- `/search` answers
    with `results`, `/relevant-files` with `files`, chat with `citations` --
    and a rule that covers the shapes it knows beats a crash on the rest.
