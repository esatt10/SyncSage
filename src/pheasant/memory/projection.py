"""Project memory record files into queryable SQLite rows (Step 33.5).

Memory records are source content — one append-only Markdown file each — and
that stays true. What was missing is that their *metadata* was reachable only
as prose inside the indexed chunk text: `scope`, `subject`, `asserted_at` and
`supersedes` were BM25 terms, not columns. Nothing could ask for "user-scope
memories about deployment", and nothing could drop a corrected record at query
time — supersession was enforced only by the batch consolidation pass, so a
memory that had already been corrected stayed retrievable until a full re-sync
ran.

This module builds the projection. It is deliberately a *derivation*, never a
second source of truth: every field comes from the files, so
`replace_memory_records` can rebuild a source wholesale and losing the table
costs a re-sync rather than data.

Rule 1 holds by construction — this is frontmatter parsing and interval
arithmetic, no model and no network.
