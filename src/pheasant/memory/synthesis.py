"""Phase 4/6 — L3 synthesis: the one non-deterministic compaction tier.

Deterministic methods (L0 normalize, L1 cluster, L2 select — `normalize`,
`compaction`) fold *redundancy*: many surface forms of one claim collapse
losslessly into one record. None of them can **merge**: turn "runs in
us-east-2" and "owned by ada" into one record stating both, fold ten
progressive-refinement records into one, or abstract "deploy failed
Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday" into "deploys have been failing all week". That
is genuinely generative, and CLAUDE.md rule 1 forbids an LLM on the
*indexing* path for exactly the reason this module respects: **the model
here is a writer, never an indexer.** It produces one ordinary record file
through the same append-only path a human or agent write uses; the
deterministic pipeline then indexes it identically to every other record.
No LLM call ever happens inside indexing, and `pytest` stays network-free
by construction — the default `provider` resolves to nothing reachable —
not by mocking.

Off by default (`memory.synthesis.enabled`) and never invoked from the
scheduler beat: only the explicit `memory_synthesize` MCP tool /
`POST /memory/synthesize` call it. Efficiency, in order of what actually
saves calls:

1. The model never sees anything L1/L2 already resolved — only clusters
   still `tier='hot'` after compaction, size-gated so a genuinely tiny
   group is left for L2 (which is lossless) rather than spent on a model
   call.
2. Content-addressed caching: a cluster's member-id set + model id + rule
   id hashes into `params_hash`, checked against the `memory_compactions`
   ledger *before* any call — a repeat pass over unchanged clusters costs
   zero.
3. `max_calls_per_pass` bounds what an unbounded first pass could spend.
4. `LLM.try_complete` degrades to "skip this cluster" on any failure — a
   pass always completes, never half-fails the rest of its work.

The synthesized record `subsumes` its members through the same mechanism
Phase 3's medoid promotion uses (`StateStore.subsume_records`, `op=
"synthesize"`) — not `supersedes`: the inputs are not corrected, they are
redundant-but-still-true, exactly compaction's existing category. Every
member keeps its `written_by`/scope, so the synthesized record inherits
the cluster's own writer (never a synthetic identity) and its ACL stays
exactly what a member's would have been. `tags` and the ledger's
`rule_id`/`params_hash` (which encodes the model id) keep a generated
record permanently distinguishable from a written one.
