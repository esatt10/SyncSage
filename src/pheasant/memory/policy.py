"""Query-time memory policy (Step 33.6).

Before this, memory was invisible at retrieval time. A memory chunk looked like
any other Markdown note, the only lever was `exclude_sources=["<name>"]` — MCP
only, and only if the caller already knew the source's configured name — and a
*superseded* record stayed retrievable until the batch consolidation pass
archived it and a full re-sync ran. That last one is the stale-fact error the
agent-memory literature names as the primary defect: the region knows the fact
was corrected and serves the old one anyway.

`MemoryPolicy` is the one knob, spelled identically on every protocol. It is
optional everywhere and its default reproduces the pre-33.6 behavior, except
that a corrected record is no longer returned — which is a bug fix, not a
policy choice.

**One rule, two renderings.** Validity is filtered in SQL for the text arm
(post-filtering a globally-ranked page can return nothing from a narrow slice
while its rows sit just past the cut) and in Python for the vector and graph
arms. Those two have to agree exactly, and they used to be two independent
transcriptions of the same rule that a parity test compared afterwards.

They are now one definition with two renderers. :func:`clauses` builds the rule
as a list of :class:`Clause` objects, each carrying its SQL fragment *and* its
Python predicate in one place; :func:`sql_predicate` joins the first,
:func:`admits` evaluates the second. The value is visible in the corners: the
"an empty string means unset" rule needs `NULLIF(tier,'')` in SQL and
`or "hot"` in Python, and getting one without the other silently excluded rows
from one arm only. Both spellings now sit on adjacent lines of the same object,
where nobody can change one without seeing the other.

`tests/test_memory_policy.py` still compares the two over a matrix of records
— not as the thing keeping them in agreement, but because a renderer can be
wrong on its own.
