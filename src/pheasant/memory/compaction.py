"""Phase 3/6 — deterministic near-duplicate clustering and medoid promotion.

L1 (cluster) + L2 (select): the offline, reversible half of compaction.
Unlike L0 (`memory.normalize`), which runs on the write path and may only
fold *exact* equivalents, this stage is allowed to be fuzzy — its output is
a **tier change**, never a deletion. A cluster's losers are marked
``tier='cold'`` and ``subsumed_by=<medoid>`` in SQL; their `.md` files are
never touched, never renamed, and stay fully indexed and reachable via an
explicit tier filter or `current_only=False`/`as_of` (`memory.policy`).
Nothing here removes text from the store.

Bucketing mirrors L0's ACL constraint exactly: never across scope, never
across kind (steering records are retrieval machinery, exempt from
clustering the same way `memory.maintenance._prune_to_capacity` exempts
them from the capacity cap), never across ACL partition
(`memory.normalize.acl_class_for` — the same partition
`security.acl.normalize_acl` enforces at read time).

Candidate generation reuses the postings + exact-Jaccard shape already
written — and proven — at `graph.enrichment._similarity_edges`, dormant
there only because it keys off the retired `concept_terms`. Reused here on
normalized content tokens instead: buckets are small by construction (one
region, one scope/subject/kind/ACL combination), so an inverted index plus
exact Jaccard needs no probabilistic signature (MinHash/LSH), and every
decision it makes is exact rather than approximate.

Determinism throughout: bucket keys and record ids are iterated in sorted
order, every similarity score is rounded to 6 decimals before comparison
(the same precision `memory.salience.salience` already commits to, since a
sum of ratios is order-dependent in the last bit otherwise), and every tie
— which pair links, which record is the medoid — breaks on the lowest
`record_id`. `datetime.now()` never appears here; `now` is always threaded
in by the caller, exactly as `MemoryStore.consolidate` requires.
