"""Memory that improves *every* query, not just the ones it answers (Step 33.8).

Through 33.7 memory was content: something to retrieve. This is the other half
— a record whose payload is not prose to return but a deterministic *retrieval
rule*. It is the cheapest large win available, because it changes ranking on
queries that return no memory at all.

Three kinds, each parsed from the record's own text:

* ``alias``      — ``router -> pheasant-flock, flock``. Expands the query, so
  asking about "the router" finds documents that only ever say
  "pheasant-flock". This is the deterministic form of the learned query
  rewriting the agentic-search literature builds with a policy network; an
  agent that already knows the synonym just writes it down.
* ``preference`` — ``when: deploy, docker -> prefer: docs/, deploy/``. Adds a
  path prior alongside the existing depth / tests / samples ones.
* ``exclusion``  — ``never: vendor/**``. Suppresses candidates outright.

**Scope gating is a security property, not a nicety.** A rule applies only to a
query whose `MemoryPolicy` admits the record's scope, so `session` steering is
confined to that session and `user` steering to that principal. Without it one
agent's note silently re-ranks another's searches — and `org` steering, which
*is* fleet-wide, is the reason that has to be deliberate rather than incidental.

Rule 1 holds by construction: parsing is regex over text an agent already
wrote, no model and no network.
