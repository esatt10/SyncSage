"""Append-only agent-memory record store (Product Framework Step 33.1).

The load-bearing design decision: **memory records are source content**.
A record is one Markdown file under the memory source's directory —
frontmatter above the memory text — and indexing it is the ordinary
deterministic chunk→embed→graph pipeline over a filesystem source. The
write path below only ever *creates files*; it never touches the indexing
path, so the no-LLM/determinism pillar and the engine's sha256 idempotency
apply to memory exactly as to any other source.

Record ids are deterministic: ``mem-<asserted-at>-<blake2b8(scope|subject|text)>``.
An identical write is reported as not-created — append-only, nothing is
ever overwritten. Identity is the **digest**, not the timestamp: re-asserting
the same thing returns the record already stored however much later it
happens (Step 33.5; before that it deduplicated only within the same
wall-clock second, which was a race rather than a rule). A write that
differs in any way the digest covers — corrected text, a different writer,
kind or validity window — is a genuinely new assertion and gets its own
record. Consolidation of supersedes-chains is Step 33.2's job.

Schema version 2 (Step 33.5) adds ``kind``, ``written_by``, ``valid_from``
and ``valid_until``. **Version 1 records stay valid forever** — nothing on
disk is rewritten (rule 2), :func:`MemoryStore.load` fills the new fields
with their v1 meanings, and the id digest only grows extra parts for
values a v1 record could not have carried, so **every v1 record id is
reproduced byte-identically**. See :func:`_digest_input`.

        ``supersede_retention_days`` (Phase 2) is what repairs the documented
        ``as_of`` guarantee: a record that just became superseded or
        TTL-expired is *not* archived immediately. It stays a live file,

        by the query-time ``valid_until`` predicate exactly as before, but
        still reachable via ``as_of`` or ``current_only=False`` — until
        ``supersede_retention_days`` have passed since it stopped being
        current. Only then is it actually archived. ``0`` (opt-in) reproduces

        there.

        :meth:`list_records` call — a caller that runs a second store
