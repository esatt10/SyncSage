"""Memory consolidation maintenance (Product Framework Step 33.2).

One pass = ``MemoryStore.consolidate`` (archive superseded / TTL-expired
record files — a pure content operation) followed by a **targeted** removal
of just those records' indexed state when anything was archived (Phase 0):
below ``MEMORY_TARGETED_ARCHIVE_MAX`` archived records, delete their rows and
rebuild the (small) memory projection directly; at or above it, fall back to
the unconditional full sync the pre-Phase-0 code always ran. Runs from the
21.1 scheduler loop, and on demand via the ``memory_consolidate`` MCP tool /
``POST /memory/consolidate``.

#: degrades to a scan of the whole FTS table — fine for a handful of
#: archived records, the wrong trade once a pass archives most of the store
#: (the measured shape of that trap: 500 -> 8,000 files went 1.9s -> 164.7s
#: under the per-row path, Phase 35.7). A full sync of the memory source
#: rebuilds `chunks_fts` wholesale instead, which is cheap regardless of how
#: many records changed. SQLite-only concern: Postgres has
#: `idx_chunks_fts_artifact` and pays neither cost.
