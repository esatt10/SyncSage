"""LongMemEval-style memory-recall benchmark (Product Framework Step 33.4).

Deterministic and fully offline: a seeded generator writes synthetic memory
histories through the **real** write path (``memory_write``) and scores
recall through the **real** search path (``search_context``) — no mocked
retrieval anywhere. Categories follow the LongMemEval taxonomy where it
maps onto region memory:

- **single-hop recall** — a fact written once must surface in the top-k
  for its natural-language question;
- **multi-session interference** — recall holds against a large body of
  distractor memories written across other sessions/subjects;
- **knowledge updates** — a superseding write followed by consolidation
  must make the *current* fact retrievable and the stale one absent;
- **abstention** — questions about never-stored entities must not surface
  confident hits.

Phase 5 adds a fifth, non-LongMemEval category — **redundancy** — because
none of the four above says anything about the failure mode the compaction
plan exists for: an agent restating the same fact in fresh words every time
it comes up. `run_memory_redundancy_benchmark` measures how much of that L0
(reinforcement) and L1/L2 (clustering) actually absorb, through the same
real `memory_write` / `memory_consolidate` paths.

A true LongMemEval run (LLM-judged answers over the published dataset,
scored against Mem0/Zep) needs network + an LLM and is tracked as manual
release-channel work; this harness is the runnable, regression-gated
proxy. Reproduce the recorded numbers with::
