"""Connect memory records to the corpus they are about (Step 33.7).

Memory was a graph island. A record naming a file, a class or a contract
section produced no edge to any of them, so the graph arm could never reach
corpus content *through* a memory or a memory through corpus content — the one
thing that would make remembered context more than a parallel store.

**`entity` cannot be the bridge on its own**, which is why this is a ladder
rather than a single rule. Entity extraction only runs for `.md/.txt/.html/.xml`
(`MarkdownDocumentEnrichmentPass`), so all seven extracted document formats
produce zero entity nodes; inside Python only class names become entities;
other languages get neither pass. An entity-only bridge looks fine on a
Markdown corpus and is a silent no-op on a corpus of PDFs.

So each record is matched by the strongest signal that fires:

1. **reference** — the record names a path, a `[[wikilink]]` or a URL. Already
   works: records are `.md`, so `_markdown_links` emits an `external_reference`
   and `resolve_cross_source_edges` resolves it to the real file. This module
   only has to *notice* it happened, so a record with an explicit pointer is
   not also matched by a weaker rung.
2. **symbol** — the record names something in the `symbols` table
   (`name` or `qualified_name`). Covers code, where entities barely exist.
3. **heading** — the record names an extracted section. Covers structured
   documents, which is exactly where entities are absent.
4. **entity** — normalized label equality against a *corpus* entity.

Rung 5 in the design — a lexical BM25 anchor — is deliberately **not**
materialized here. Writing lexical edges is how the retired concept layer became
87.2% of nodes and 98.6% of edges; the search index already answers that
question at query time, for free and always fresh.

Everything is deterministic string matching over already-indexed rows: no
model, no network, rule 1 by construction.
