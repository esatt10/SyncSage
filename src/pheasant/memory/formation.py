"""Turning recorded interactions into memory, deterministically.

The observation plane records what was asked, on which surface, by whom, and
what came back. This is the half that reads it -- and the boundary it must not
cross is the whole design: **an observation is evidence, a record is memory,
and only an admission crosses.** Admission goes through
:meth:`pheasant.memory.store.MemoryStore.append` like every other write, so
memory's first invariant ("records are files, no second ingestion path, no
direct index writes") never bends here.

**No model runs in this path.** Rules are counting and string matching over
recorded rows, so a pass is reproducible: the same ledger and the same
parameters produce byte-identical text, and therefore -- because a record's id
is a digest of ``scope|subject|text`` -- the same record id. That is what makes
a repeat pass free rather than merely idempotent-by-luck: an unchanged session
re-derives the record it already wrote and the store dedups it on the file.

## The session digest

The first rule, and the one plan 2 was written about: *a session has a single
memory, refined through dialog.* That needs no new primitive. It is a
supersession chain --- scope ``session``, subject the session id, each
refinement naming the previous one in ``supersedes`` --- so:

* ``current_only`` (on by default) returns **exactly one** record per session;
* ``as_of`` reads the session's history, which is the point of invalidating
  rather than overwriting;
* consolidation archives the chain on the ordinary beat;
* ``session_ttl_days`` decays it like any other session-scope memory.

**Why this is written automatically while everything else is proposed.** A
session digest is `scope: session`, subject that session, written by that
principal --- so under ``security.acl_enforced`` only its own writer can read
it, and it decays with the session. It never becomes shared knowledge: reaching
``user`` or ``org`` scope takes an explicit promotion, which is exactly the
"nothing persists into the knowledge base unless a person adds it" the design
asks for. What is automatic here is a session's memory of itself.

A digest is written only for a session with at least
``memory.formation.min_observations`` recorded interactions. One question is
not a dialog, and a record per drive-by query would be the unbounded growth the
capacity rules exist to prevent.
