"""WASM-sandboxed PDF text extraction.

Why sandboxing rather than acceleration
---------------------------------------
Phase 34 shipped two WASM tracks: a capability-scoped sandbox for untrusted
guest code (34.1-34.3) and selective hot-loop acceleration (34.5). Document
extraction belongs to the **first** track, and the 34.4/34.6 measurements say
so plainly: a WASM ``Store``+``Instance`` costs ~115 µs fixed, and extraction
runs **once per file** — the same "small units, called often" shape that made
34.6 (WASM chunking) a documented NO-GO. Speed is not the argument here, and
this module makes no speed claim.

The argument is the threat model 34.2 already named: *"Confluence's in-process
BeautifulSoup parse of untrusted remote XHTML"*. PDF is the sharper version of
that same problem. PDF bytes arrive at a region from Google Drive, Slack
uploads, Confluence attachments and IMAP mail — none of it authored by the
operator, all of it fed to a parser. In-process that parse sits inside the
sync worker with the worker's ambient authority: environment variables holding
every configured connector's API token, the writable ``/state`` directory, and
network egress. A malicious PDF that subverts the parser inherits all of it.

Run through this module the tokenizer instead gets:

- a **fuel cap** — a hostile file that drives the scanner into a pathological
  loop exhausts its budget and raises :class:`SandboxFuelExhausted` rather
  than hanging the sync;
- a **linear-memory cap** — allocation-amplifying input traps instead of
  invoking the host OOM killer;
- **zero host capabilities** — the linker defines *no* imports at all, not
  even 34.1's ``host_fetch`` pair, so there is no ambient environment,
  filesystem, or network for a subverted parse to reach. A guest that so much
  as declares an import fails to instantiate (34.3's guarantee).

Honest scope boundary
---------------------
The guest receives **already-inflated** content streams: the host still runs
``zlib`` to decompress them (see
:func:`pheasant.ingestion.extractor.iter_pdf_content_streams`). So this is a
*partial* sandbox, and saying otherwise would overstate it — in the same
spirit as 34.2's documented deviation about host-side directory listing. The
split is deliberate rather than incidental:

- ``zlib`` is a small, extremely well-audited surface whose only
  attacker-driven risk is output amplification, and that is already bounded
  by ``MAX_STREAM_INFLATED_BYTES``.
- The *tokenizer* is where attacker-controlled bytes drive unbounded loops,
  index arithmetic, and nesting depth. That is the part with real
  memory-safety and denial-of-service surface, and that is the part that runs
  inside the cap.

Correctness is not taken on trust
---------------------------------
The guest is a port, so it can drift from the Python reference in ways a
sandbox cannot catch — a wrong answer traps nothing. ``pdf_scan_text`` in the
vendored Rust crate is therefore asserted **byte-for-byte identical** to
:func:`~pheasant.ingestion.extractor.scan_pdf_content_stream` in
``tests/test_document_extraction.py``, the same discipline 34.5 used ("every
scale point asserts the WASM output is byte-for-byte identical to the Python
reference before any timing counts").

Failure posture
---------------
A security control that silently degrades is worse than one that fails loudly,
so this module deviates from 34.5's fall-back-on-any-exception policy in one
specific way: if ``wasmtime`` is missing, construction **raises** with an
actionable hint rather than quietly extracting unsandboxed — an operator who
wrote ``provider: sandboxed`` asked for isolation and must not silently get
none. Per-*file* failures behave the opposite way: a file that exhausts its
fuel or traps yields no text for that file and logs, never aborting the sync.
