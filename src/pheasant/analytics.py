"""Columnar exports of indexed state, and a SQL surface over them.

`/exports` is defined as regenerable payloads, and this is the regenerable
payload an analyst wants: one Parquet file per table, written into
``<exports_path>/parquet/<kb_id>/``, queryable by DuckDB, pandas, polars,
Spark, DuckDB-WASM in a browser — anything that reads Parquet — with no
pheasant process running and no Python dependency on this package.

**This module never writes to `/state` and never holds a lease.** It opens
the state store read-only-in-practice (it issues nothing but ``SELECT``) and
loads the graph the same way the server does, so exporting while a sync runs
is a WAL reader alongside the writer, not a second writer. That property is
the whole reason the export is safe to run on a schedule.

Why DuckDB, and why only here
-----------------------------
DuckDB is a Parquet writer and a query engine, and it is **not** a state
backend: pheasant's write path is per-artifact ``DELETE`` + re-``INSERT``,
conditional-``UPDATE`` lease claims and ``UPDATE … RETURNING`` queue claims,
which is the workload a bulk-columnar engine is worst at; its full-text index
cannot be maintained incrementally (it is rebuilt wholesale), which would
turn "a re-sync of an untouched corpus does no work" into "every sync
rebuilds the index"; and its single-writer *file lock* blocks other processes
from opening the database at all, where SQLite's WAL is what lets the scaled
compose file mount `/state:ro` on the API replicas while the indexer writes.
So DuckDB earns its place on the read side, off the sync path, owning
nothing — and it is an optional extra, because a region that never exports
should not carry a 20 MB wheel.

Rows are streamed by **keyset pagination on the primary key** rather than
read into a list. The table this exists for is ``chunks``, whose every row
carries the chunk's full text: materializing it means peak memory
proportional to the corpus, which is exactly the size that motivates
exporting in the first place. ``OFFSET`` paging would have been the other
obvious answer and is quadratic — the same shape as the O(N²) FTS delete this
codebase already paid for once. Keyset paging rides the primary-key index on
both backends and, as a side effect, makes row order deterministic.

Rows reach DuckDB as **newline-delimited JSON**, not as bound parameters, and
that is worth more than it looks: DuckDB's Python parameter binder costs about
100 microseconds *per value*, so a 13-column table ran at 1.9 ms per row —
40 seconds for 20,000 rows, and it made the export slower than the sync that
produced the data. Staging the same rows as NDJSON and letting ``read_json``
parse them measured **48 microseconds per row on identical output**, a 40x
difference that is entirely DuckDB's binding path and not the writes. JSON
rather than CSV because it carries real nulls, real numbers and correct
escaping for the quotes, newlines and unicode that live in chunk text — a CSV
staging file would need a quoting scheme, and getting that subtly wrong
corrupts the export silently.

Nothing is staged in a DuckDB *table*: the ``COPY`` reads the NDJSON and
writes the Parquet in one streaming statement, so there is no scratch
database, no spill directory, and no second copy of the corpus in RAM. The
staging file is written per table and deleted as soon as that table's Parquet
lands, so transient disk is bounded by the largest single table rather than by
all of them.

#: Rows the Parquet writer buffers before flushing a row group.
#:
#: DuckDB's default is 122,880, which on ``chunks`` — whose rows carry the full
#: chunk text — is a third of a gigabyte of buffer per writer thread, and it is
#: **unspillable**: the memory limit below cannot page it out, so a large
#: default here is what turns a low limit into an out-of-memory error rather
#: than a spill. At 5,000 the buffer is ~13 MB per thread. Measured on a real
#: 16,000-file corpus, 5,000 beat 20,000 on peak RSS at every memory limit

#: What DuckDB may hold before it spills to :data:`_TEMP_DIRNAME`.
#:
#: **This is what makes the export's memory flat instead of proportional.**
#: Left at DuckDB's default (80% of system RAM) the COPY grows with the table:
#: 696 MB at 100k rows, 1,238 MB at 400k, 1,805 MB at 1M, still climbing. With
#: this limit the same three sizes peak at 585 MB, 707 MB and 646 MB — no trend
#: across a 10x range — on a fixture whose every row is unique incompressible
#: text. On a real corpus, where chunks share vocabulary, a 16,000-file export
#: peaks at 258 MB. A container sized for the sync can therefore always run the
#: export, at any corpus size.
#:
#: 512 MB and not lower: 128 MB measured beautifully on a synthetic fixture and
#: then **failed outright on real data** with
#: ``OutOfMemoryException: failed to allocate 48.4 MiB (75.3/122.0 MiB used)``.
#: The fixture repeated one string, so dictionary encoding crushed the writer's
#: working set and understated it by roughly 3x. This codebase has the rule
#: already — a live run finds what the suite cannot — and this is the constant
#: that proves it. Re-measure on real content before touching it.
_MEMORY_LIMIT = "512MB"

#: Where DuckDB spills when it hits :data:`_MEMORY_LIMIT`. Inside the export
