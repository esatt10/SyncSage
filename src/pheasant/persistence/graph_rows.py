"""The knowledge graph as rows, written by delta (Phase 35.10).

The graph was one zstd node-link blob. Every commit re-serialized the whole
thing and every process that answered a graph query held the whole thing
resident. Measured with ``python -m pheasant.graph.capacity`` on this repo's
own synthetic corpus, at 100k files (630k nodes / 630k edges):

===================================  ==========  ==========
                                     file        rows
===================================  ==========  ==========
commit after a one-file change       9.1 s       0.001 s
load before a replica can serve      4.6 s       none
resident bytes to answer a query     1.5 GB      none
3-hop bounded traversal              in-RAM      0.13 ms
===================================  ==========  ==========

The commit number is the one that matters, and not because 9 seconds is slow:
it is **O(total graph)** where the change was O(one file), it runs while the
sync mutex is held, and one process is the sole commit authority per shard
(``sync/saturation.py``). That made corpus size, not write rate, the thing
that saturated the commit stream — and the only documented way past it was to
shard the region. As rows the same commit is a millisecond *and flat in graph
size*.

**What this deliberately does not change.**

* The graph is still published as immutable generations with a
  content-addressed id. See :meth:`GraphRowStore.publish`.
* Stable IDs are untouched (CLAUDE.md rule 3). A node id is a node id; this
  changes where it is stored, not what it is.
* Snapshots stay files. They are history, they are read whole or not at all,
  and they are interval-gated rather than per-commit — so materializing one
  from rows at O(N) is the right cost in the right place.
* Nothing new is introduced. These are two tables in the state store the
  region already runs, in both dialects, next to the artifacts and chunks the
  same commit writes — which also means the graph and the chunks it describes
  now land in **one transaction** instead of a database write followed by a
  separate file rename.

The row↔attribute codec and the generation fold live in
:mod:`pheasant.persistence.graph_codec` and are re-exported here, so every
existing import of this module keeps working.

        One query per *level* rather than per node. The primary key already
        leads with ``(kb_id, source)``, so this is a range scan over the key
        and needs no index of its own.

        Ordered by ``(target, type, seq)`` and not by insertion. The in-memory
        graph enumerates neighbours in insertion order, which decides which
        ones survive a caller's ``max_nodes`` — an order the rows cannot
        reproduce and should not pretend to. A stable, stated ordering is the
        honest replacement; ``tests/test_graph_backends.py`` asserts the two
        backends return the same *set* and each is internally deterministic,
        rather than asserting an equality that is not true.

        Grouped by endpoint pair here rather than flat-then-regrouped by the
        caller. The two-pass version built one tuple per edge and then one dict
        per pair over the same rows, which is invisible on an ordinary node and
        not on a hub: a ``source`` node indexing 8,000 artifacts made that
        ~15ms of pure object churn per traversal. The ``ORDER BY`` already
        clusters a pair's rows together, so one pass is enough.

        ``targets`` asks for the **induced sub-graph** — edges from this set
        into that one — and is the difference between reading a hub's whole
        fan-out and reading the part of it a caller can use. A bounded slice
        of 51 nodes fetched **3,580** edge rows to keep ~150, because one of
        those nodes is a ``source`` that indexes every artifact in its
        repository; asking the database for the intersection is 0.96 ms
        against 16.7 ms and the answer is identical, since the caller
        discarded every other row anyway. Unlike :func:`_pair_clauses` the
        cross product is *wanted* here — "every edge from S to S" is the
        question — so this needs no ``OR`` chain and stays two ``IN`` lists.

        ``priority_types`` and ``limit_per_source`` let a *bounded* walk stop
        reading a hub's whole fan-out. A depth-3 walk asking for 100
        neighbours off a ``source`` node read **1,620 pairs to keep 100**,
        because the budget bound the walk and nothing bound the fetch. The
        ordering is what makes a limit safe to apply at all: a pair ranks
        ahead of another when *any* of its edges carries a priority type,
        which is exactly what
        :func:`~pheasant.graph.traversal._hierarchy_first` computes, so a
        prefix here is the same prefix the caller would have taken. It has to
        be a per-*pair* aggregate — a per-edge ``CASE`` would split a pair
        carrying both a priority edge and an ordinary one across two rank
        groups and hand the caller that pair twice with half its edges each.

        The window sort costs more on the server than shipping the rows does
        (2.96ms against 2.54ms). It still wins by 2.7× — **10.40ms against
        3.81ms** — because the rows that never arrive are also rows nobody
        decodes and groups, which is where the time actually was. Measuring
        the statement alone said the opposite.

        Whether a limit is *sound* is the caller's to decide, not this
        module's: see :func:`~pheasant.graph.traversal._out_edges_for`.
