"""Resolving the database DSN without ever putting it in a config file.

A Postgres DSN carries a password. pheasant's house rule for every other
credential — connector tokens, embedding keys, the Ed25519 signing seed — is
that only the *name* of an environment variable reaches YAML
(``connector.api_key_env``, ``search.embeddings.api_key_env``,
``synapse.signing_key_ref``). Storage is not an exception, so
``storage.dsn_env`` is a variable name and there is deliberately no
``storage.dsn`` field to paste a password into.
