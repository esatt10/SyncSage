#: Attributes promoted out of ``attrs`` into their own column. Chosen because
#: something filters or joins on each of them — not to make rows look tidy.
#: They are stored once: :func:`node_row` removes them from the JSON and
#: :func:`node_attrs` merges them back, so the projection lives in one place.

PROMOTED_EDGE_KEYS = ("type", "source_id")

#: The composite key of ``graph_edges``, in its declared order. Named once
#: because it is both the primary key and the order every streaming read
#: pages by, and those two agreeing is what makes the paging a range scan.
EDGE_KEY = ("source", "target", "type", "seq")

#: Rows per statement. The same figure ``persistence/migrate.py`` uses, for the
#: same reason: a million-row table should not be a million round trips, and a
#: parameter list should not be measured in gigabytes.
BATCH = 1_000

#: Endpoint *sources* per statement when addressing edges by exact pair.
#:
#: Deliberately far smaller than :data:`BATCH`. Addressing pairs needs an
#: ``OR`` chain — ``source IN (…) AND target IN (…)`` is a cross product, which
#: over-matches, and over-matching here would fold out digests that were never
#: replaced and delete edges nobody touched. An ``OR`` chain nests one level
#: per term, and SQLite refuses an expression tree deeper than 1000 outright:
#: batching pairs at ``BATCH`` raised "Expression tree is too large" on the
#: first real graph. Grouping the targets under each source keeps the chain
#: proportional to *distinct sources*, and this caps that.
PAIR_GROUP_BATCH = 100

#: Targets listed per source inside one group. An ``IN`` list is one node in
#: the tree however long it is, so this bounds the parameter count rather than
#: the depth.
PAIR_TARGET_BATCH = 400

#: Hex digits of SHA-256 kept per row. 128 bits is far past what a collision
#: between two versions of one region's node needs, and the fold is stored as
#: text so it reads in a `SELECT` and survives both dialects without a bytea
#: round trip.
