"""What a knowledge graph actually costs, measured (Phase 35.3).

pheasant holds the whole graph in memory as a :class:`~pheasant.graph.simple.
SimpleMultiDiGraph` and persists it as one zstd node-link blob. That is fine
at 5 MB of corpus and impossible at hundreds of GB, and the interesting
question — the one that decides whether to shard, to move the graph into the
database, or to do nothing — is *where between those it stops being fine*.

Phase 34.7 asked a version of this and answered "not a memory problem",
measuring 20.5 MB at 13.5k nodes and 205 MB at 135k. That was true and is
still true, but it stopped at 10x the demo corpus and drew the conclusion for
every scale. This module exists so the recommendation is a number rather than
an extrapolation, and so it can be re-run on real hardware instead of trusted
from a doc.

Run it with ``python -m pheasant.graph.capacity``. Deterministic, offline, and
it measures four things per scale point:

* **resident bytes** — what the container actually has to be given, via
  ``tracemalloc`` for the graph itself plus RSS delta for the true cost
  including interpreter overhead;
* **persisted bytes** — compressed and uncompressed, since the uncompressed
  size is what a save has to serialize and hold transiently;
* **save and load seconds** — the load is what a restart pays before serving,
  and the save is what every checkpoint pays;
* **edge-scan milliseconds** — the ``_scan_edges`` query path, which is
  O(edges) with no index and lands on user-visible search latency.
