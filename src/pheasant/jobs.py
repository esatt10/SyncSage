"""Background work you can watch: one registry for every long-running job.

A first index of a real repository takes minutes; of a large collection, hours.
Before this, the only thing the UI could say about that was a boolean —
``syncing: true`` on a source row, flipping to nothing when the sync finished —
which is indistinguishable from a hang for as long as it runs. That is the gap
this module closes: every background job gets an id, a phase, counters, a tail
of what it last did, and a terminal outcome that survives the job itself.

**Per source, not per job (Phase 35.1).** A ``sync_all`` over eight sources used
to be one job with one counter, so the one source that was stuck was invisible
behind the seven that were fine — and the counter's denominator changed under
your feet as each source discovered its own file list. Each source now gets its
own :class:`SourceProgress` record; the job-level :class:`JobProgress` is an
aggregate derived from them, kept so existing callers and the UI keep working.

**Throughput and ETA are observed, not reported.** The indexing child process
sends phase/counter updates over the existing progress wire; this module stamps
its own clock on arrival and derives files-per-second over a sliding window and
an ETA from that. Deriving them here rather than sending them keeps the wire
unchanged and means a caller that never emits a rate still gets one.

**"Slow" and "stuck" are different answers.** ``seconds_since_progress`` is
always reported, so a UI can say "last update 4s ago" during healthy work.
``stalled`` only trips after :data:`STALL_AFTER_SECONDS`, which is deliberately
generous: a single large PDF, or an embedding provider serving a retry with
backoff, is slow but fine, and a progress bar that cries wolf gets ignored.

Still deliberately **in-memory and process-local**, as when this module
replaced the ``syncing_sources``/``sync_outcomes`` dicts. Phase 35.1c revisits
that — with more than one replica an in-process registry is structurally wrong
— but it is a storage change, not a model change, and the model had to be worth
persisting first.
