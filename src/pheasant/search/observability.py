"""What each retrieval stage did, emitted from the live path.

The tuning plane can already attribute a miss to the stage that caused it —
but only inside a *replay*, with `explain=True`, over a cohort. That leaves
production retrieval with two signals (`pheasant_search_duration_seconds` and
`pheasant_search_total`), neither of which can name a stage, and it leaves a
region's diagnosis only as fresh as its last batch. A ranking regression
introduced by an applied bundle is then invisible until somebody runs another
one, which is exactly the window in which you would want to notice.

So stage observation is split in two, by cost:

**Always on: counters.** Every search increments in-memory counters for each
arm's outcome and candidate count, each filter's drops, the fusion's arm
agreement, and — when a search returns nothing — the last stage that still had
candidates. This is the live version of the tuning plane's histogram. It costs
a dict lookup and an integer add per search against the registry that already
serves `/metrics`; **no database write reaches the request path**, which is the
rule the observation plane's hot tier exists to keep (a ledger write per
request puts a write on the same Postgres the lexical arm already contends on).

**Sampled: the stage digest.** A fraction of searches attach a compact
per-stage summary to their interaction-ledger row. That gives the tuning plane
a *live* diagnosis source alongside replay, and gives an operator a real query
to look at when a counter moves. It is sampled rather than universal because
the digest is ~40x the bytes of the row it rides on, and because a ledger sized
for search traffic should not be resized by a diagnostic.

Two things this deliberately does **not** do.

It does not record what was retrieved beyond ids already in the row. The digest
is counts and stage names — never chunk text, never a new copy of the results.

It does not turn a sampled search into evidence. A stage digest says the
pipeline did something; it says nothing about whether the answer was useful.
Proof still only comes from a surface where somebody said so, and mining "this
was served at rank 1" out of these counters would produce a metric that
improves whenever ranking gets more confident regardless of whether it gets
more correct.
