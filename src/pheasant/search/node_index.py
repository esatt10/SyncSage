"""A searchable index of graph nodes, in SQLite.

Graph-mode search used to score every node in memory. That is O(nodes) per
query and it does not care how selective the query is: on a 500k-node graph a
single search cost 2.5s idle and over 10s while indexing ran, and the agent
loop issues several per question. Chunk text has never had this problem —
it lives in an FTS5 index — so graph nodes get the same treatment.

The index is a **cache derived from the graph**, never a second source of
truth. It can be deleted at any time and rebuilt from the in-memory graph, and
graph search falls back to the in-memory scan whenever it is empty or
unavailable. That keeps the graph the only thing that has to be correct.

One semantic change, deliberate: FTS matches tokens and prefixes where the old
scan matched arbitrary substrings, so a query for ``exec`` finds
``executor`` (token prefix) but no longer finds ``myexecutor`` (infix). This
is the same matching the text search over chunks has always used, and the
candidates it returns are still ranked by the original scorer.
