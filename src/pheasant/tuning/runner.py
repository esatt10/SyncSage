"""One tuning batch: diagnose, propose, trial, decide, package.

The four movements are separate phases with separate durable artifacts rather
than steps inside a function, because each one is independently useful and each
one is something an operator may want to stop after. A region that runs only
the diagnosis and reads "71% of your misses are documents that were never
indexed" has got the most valuable thing this plane produces without changing a
single parameter.

**The batch is resumable, not merely idempotent.** The experiment id is
content-addressed over (region, snapshot, space, cohort, budget), so a restarted
container re-derives the same id, loads the trials already stored, and evaluates
only what is missing. Trials are checkpointed as they complete for the same
reason the evaluation plane checkpoints replays: the expensive part is the
retrieval, so remember what was retrieved.

**It is read-only unless something applies a bundle.** Every phase below writes
to the ``tuning_*`` tables and to cold storage, and nothing else. The region's
ranking changes at exactly one point -- ``apply_bundle`` -- and only when
``tuning.auto.apply`` is on or a person asks.

**It never takes ``sync_lock``.** It takes the ``__tuning__`` lease and yields
to indexing between units. See :mod:`.executor`.

The one structural subtlety worth stating here: the baseline replay is run
**once**, with ``explain=True``, and its captures serve two purposes at once --
they are the diagnosis's raw material *and* the substrate every re-fusion trial
is evaluated against. That is why the cheap path is cheap, and it is why
:func:`_verify_refusion` runs before any cheap trial is trusted: if the captures
do not reproduce what the region served, the whole fusion family falls back to
real searches rather than reporting numbers from a re-implementation that has
drifted.

#: The cohort roles this plane needs, mapped onto the evaluation plane's names.
#:
#: Reused rather than rebuilt, and that is the important decision here. A
#: separately-built cohort would drift from the one the evaluation plane
#: reports on, and the region would then have two different answers to "which
#: queries matter" -- with the tuning plane optimizing for one while the
#: published trend measured the other.
#: The search cohort, in order of preference. ``rolling`` first because recent
#: traffic is what a region most wants ranked well, and ``anchor`` as the
#: fallback for a region whose traffic predates the lookback window -- which is
#: the ordinary case for a corpus that was heavily used and then settled.
#:
#: Falling back to the anchor is safe only because promotion requires
#: confirmation on a *holdout*: the anchor is also the trend line, so selecting
#: on it and reporting on it would otherwise be the cohort-level version of
#: promoting a candidate by its own evidence. The report always names which
#: cohort was used.
