"""Where a tuning batch keeps things, and why it is two places.

The split is the same one the whole product is built on -- ``/state`` is
operational truth, ``/exports`` is regenerable payload -- applied to a workload
that would otherwise abuse the first.

**What goes in ``/state``**: an experiment, a trial's *scores*, a decision, a
bundle. Small rows, queried by the UI, the CLI, HTTP and MCP. A trial row stays
a few hundred bytes however large the cohort is.

**What goes in cold storage**: the per-query ranked lists behind those scores --
the stage captures, the arm candidates, the fused orders. On a 200-query cohort
with 400 trials that is 80,000 ranked lists, and they are *derivable*: given the
corpus, the snapshot and the parameters, the ranking can be recomputed. Keeping
them is worth doing (they are what makes a decision auditable months later) and
keeping them in an operational database is not.

Cold storage is ``<exports>/tuning/<kb_id>/<experiment>/*.jsonl.zst``:
zstd-compressed JSON lines, one object per query, written once and never
updated. Zstandard is already a core dependency, so this needs no extra;
JSONL because an audit reads it with ``zstdcat | jq`` and should not need this
package installed to do so.

Three properties the writes have to keep, each learned somewhere else in this
repository.

**A batch write must not lose good rows to one bad one.** A queued batch of
observations once rolled back in full because a single event carried a null
``trace_id``; the fix was to validate *before* the statement, since a
rolled-back transaction cannot drop one row and keep the rest. Trials are
validated by :meth:`Trial.validate` before they are offered to the database,
for exactly that reason.

**Cold storage is best-effort, and the row is not.** ``/exports`` can be a
read-only mount, a full volume, or absent entirely. A cold write that fails is
logged and the trial is still stored with an empty ``cold_ref`` -- losing the
audit detail is bad, losing the experiment because a volume filled is worse.

**At most one bundle is active, enforced in the write.** Applying a bundle
supersedes the incumbent in the same transaction that applies the new one. Two
active overlays would make two replicas rank differently while both reported
the fleet as converged.
