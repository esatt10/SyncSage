"""The thing that runs a batch without the region noticing.

The requirement is "an executor that does not burden the rest of the
framework", and burden here has three separate shapes, each needing its own
answer.

**Contention for the database.** A tuning batch is thousands of reads against
the same SQLite or Postgres the lexical arm serves from. So the executor holds
**one slot**. Not a pool: one. Parallelism would multiply exactly the
contention this is trying to avoid, and the batch is not latency-sensitive --
nobody is waiting for it.

**Contention with indexing.** It takes the ``__tuning__`` lease and **never**
takes ``sync_lock``. The scheduler holds ``sync_lock`` across all its work, and
a thousand-query replay inside it would stall incremental sync for every source
in the region -- the same mistake the observation plane's hot-to-cold roll was
moved outside the lock to avoid, and the same rule the evaluation plane
follows.

**Contention for the machine.** :class:`BackpressureGate` stands the batch down
while the index queue is backed up or a sync is holding a source lease, and
checks *between* units rather than once at the start: a batch that began on an
idle region and is still running when a large re-index starts must yield, not
finish what it started. Under sustained pressure it stops and the experiment is
resumable, which is the whole reason trials are checkpointed.

On platforms that support it the worker thread also drops its niceness, so the
kernel prefers the request path when both want CPU. Best-effort: it is an
optimisation, and a container without ``CAP_SYS_NICE`` simply keeps its default
priority rather than failing to start.

**Why a thread and not a role.** ``serve --role tuner`` exists as a config
posture (``tuning.auto.enabled`` on the indexer, off on the API replicas), but
the executor itself is a thread because the work is I/O-bound against the state
store and a separate process would need its own copy of the graph -- which is
the largest thing in memory and the reason the indexer coordinator does not
load one either.
