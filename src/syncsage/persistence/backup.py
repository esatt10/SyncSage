"""State backup + restore (Synapse step 21.6, session A).

A backup is a zstd-compressed tar of the *durable* region state:

- ``syncsage.db`` — a **consistent** SQLite snapshot taken via ``VACUUM INTO``
  a temp file (never a raw copy of the live db, which can tear under WAL).
  All manifests live in this db (Synapse 21.2), so they ride along for free.
- ``graphs/`` — ``graph.latest.json`` + every ``graph.<ts>.json.zst`` snapshot.
- ``contract.latest.json`` — the published semantic contract, when present.
- ``events/`` — the append-only NDJSON sync-event stream, when present.
- ``vectors/`` — the per-region vector index (Synapse 21.4), when present.

``/state`` is user data: restore is **safe by default** — it refuses to clobber
a non-empty target unless ``force=True``, and it never partially destroys the
target. It unpacks into a sibling temp dir, validates, then atomically swaps the
old directory aside (renamed to ``*.replaced-<ts>``, never deleted) before moving
the restored tree into place.
