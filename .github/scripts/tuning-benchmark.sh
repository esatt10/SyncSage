# Run the tuning plane against SciFact, and assert the numbers are real.
#
# The other CI jobs prove the plane *works*. This one proves it says something:
# a diagnosis over a corpus whose known-positives are expert annotations rather
# than something this repository wrote.
#
# What it asserts, and why each would otherwise rot silently:
#
#   1. The corpus indexed, PDFs included. A PDF that extracts as nothing is
#      accepted and then indexed as nothing — the drift that
#      DOCUMENT_EXTENSIONS/EXTRACTED_EXTENSIONS is asserted set-equal to catch.
#   2. The batch reached a decision. "Completed with no opinion" and "failed"
#      are different, and only one of them is a result.
#   3. The ablation isolated the arms. A zero-weighted arm is not an excluded
#      arm, and getting that wrong produced a "vector alone" score that was the
#      text arm's ranking verbatim.
#   4. Retrieval lands in a plausible range for the benchmark. A pipeline that
#      quietly stops ranking still completes a batch; a reciprocal rank near
#      zero on SciFact does not happen to a working lexical arm.
