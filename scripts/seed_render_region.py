"""Seed a small region for the UI render check. Prints the config path.

Its own file rather than a string inside `ui/ci-render.mjs`, for two reasons
that both cost time before it moved here. Escaping a Python program through a
JavaScript template literal is a minefield — every backslash means something to
both languages — and the first version failed with an unterminated string
literal that was invisible in either file alone. And a seeding routine that
lives in a `.mjs` is a Python program nothing lints, formats or typechecks.

It deliberately does **not** import from `tests/`. The version that did pulled
in pytest, so it passed locally where the dev extra is installed and failed in
CI's Node-only job; and a CI script coupled to test internals breaks whenever a
fixture is renamed, for a check that has nothing to do with the tests.
