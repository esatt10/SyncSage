"""One tuning batch, end to end, through the real engine.

`test_tuning_refusion.py` pins the cheap path against the real search path.
This pins the whole pass — snapshot, cohorts, stage capture, diagnosis,
proposals, trials, gates, decision, bundle — and the properties that make it
safe to leave switched on in a fleet:

* it changes nothing unless a bundle is applied, and applying is a separate act;
* an applied bundle is fleet-scoped and every replica resolves it from `/state`;
* it survives the container stopping, and resumes rather than restarting;
* it declines to tune when the diagnosis says the failures are somewhere no
  retrieval parameter reaches.
