# The stage block is a contract, and nothing was checking it
#
# `hybrid.search_context(explain=True)` produces it; `tuning.stages.attribute`
# consumes it; the whole retrieval diagnosis rests on the two agreeing. Every
# read on the consumer side is a `.get(...) or {}`, because a stage that did
# not happen is legitimately absent — which also means a *renamed* key reads as
# an absence. The plane then blames a different stage, confidently, and the
# number it publishes looks like a measurement.
#
# There is no type checker in CI, so the TypedDict in `search.explain` is
# documentation. These are the enforcement.
