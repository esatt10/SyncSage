"""Every config pheasant reads or writes must survive a real YAML round trip.

The repository used to carry a hand-rolled ``yaml.py`` at its root — a lenient
YAML subset for "dependency-light" installs. PyYAML is a declared dependency
and the shipped image has always used it, but the shim sat earlier on
``sys.path`` for anything run from a checkout, so **the test suite validated
against a different parser than the product ships with**. It concealed at least
four bugs before it was deleted. These tests pin the round trip on the parser
that actually runs in production, so that gap cannot reopen.
