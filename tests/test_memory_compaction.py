"""Phase 3 — deterministic near-duplicate clustering and medoid promotion.

Acceptance: bucketing never crosses scope, kind, or ACL partition; medoid
selection is deterministic regardless of write/iteration order; a subsumed
record's `valid_until` is never touched (distinct from `supersedes`) and
stays reachable via an explicit tier filter or `current_only=False`; the
compaction ledger is idempotent; and the whole pass is off by default.
