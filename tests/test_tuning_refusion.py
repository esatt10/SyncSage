"""The cheap path must be the same path.

Offline re-fusion is what makes a parameter search affordable: the fusion
family is evaluated by re-running the merge over cached arm lists instead of
re-running retrieval. That is only sound if the re-implementation *is* the
implementation, and this repository has already paid for the alternative --
a hand-rolled ``yaml.py`` shadowed the real parser and concealed four bugs
before it was deleted.

So the load-bearing assertion here is not "re-fusion produces plausible
results". It is: **re-fuse the captured inputs at the parameters that actually
ran, and get back exactly what the region served** -- id for id, order
included, against a real indexed corpus through the real
``HybridSearch.search_context``.
