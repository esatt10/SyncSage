"""Ranking behaviour, pinned against the failures that motivated it.

Every case here is a reduction of something measured on a real 2,132-file
corpus, where asking "locate readme" returned Python source and the
repository's own README.md sat at rank 125:

* a rare framing verb ("locate" — 15 chunks) outscored the subject noun
  ("readme" — 724 chunks), because BM25 weights by rarity and the OR-expansion
  lets every token vote;
* ``chunks_fts.title`` held the same full path already in ``path``, so a
  filename match was worth one body word and BM25 ranked by body brevity;
* 412 files were named README.md, so no lexical signal could separate them —
  the discriminator is structural (root vs. nested);
* "where is X implemented" returned X's tests;
* the three search arms scored on incomparable scales (text 0.86-0.92,
  vector 0.667-0.674, graph a flat 0.60), so hybrid silently degraded to
  text-only while paying for all three.
