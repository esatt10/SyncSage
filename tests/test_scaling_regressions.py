"""Defects found by stressing the evaluation and memory planes, pinned.

Each was invisible to the offline suite and surfaced only by running the real
thing -- a real Postgres server, a real SIGKILL, a real ``/exports`` volume,
two writes a second apart -- which is CLAUDE.md rule 10 doing its job. Each is
pinned here at the level the offline suite *can* reach, with the
backend-specific half marked and skipped when there is no server.

They share a shape worth naming. Four are failures of a **scaling** path (a
connection pool, a fleet's run identity, a retention tier, a liveness clock)
that a single-container SQLite region never exercises. And all but one are
*silent*: a timeout, a lying progress row, a report claiming rows were archived
that were not, a correction that stopped applying. Two are the same underlying
mistake in different modules -- a wall-clock second treated as a semantic
boundary -- which is why they are filed together.
