"""The batch, end to end: one run, its report, and the guarantees around it.

`test_evaluation_plane.py` pins the pieces. This pins the whole pass through
the real engine — the manifest, the cohorts, the replay through the real search
path, the metrics, the gates, the persistence — and the four properties that
make it safe to leave switched on in a fleet:

* it is reproducible over an unchanged state;
* it takes a lease, so N replicas produce one run;
* it never writes to the knowledge plane, and never makes its own measurements
  retrievable;
* it never credits a replayed retrieval as a *use*, which would let the
  evaluation raise the salience of the records it is measuring.
