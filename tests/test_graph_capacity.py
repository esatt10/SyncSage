"""Acceptance tests for Phase 35.3 — measured graph capacity and its guardrail.

The point of this step is that the recommendation is a *number*. Phase 34.7
asked the same question, measured two scales, and concluded "not a memory
problem" — true at 10x the demo corpus and false at 100x. These tests pin the
properties the recommendation rests on, not the constants themselves, which
are hardware-dependent and belong in the doc.
