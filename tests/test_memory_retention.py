"""Phase 2 — the retention window that repairs the documented `as_of`
guarantee.

Before this: `consolidate()` archived a superseded or TTL-expired record's
file the moment it stopped being current, which drops its row out of
`memory_records` entirely (a `.md.archived` file no longer matches the
source's `**/*.md` include glob). `as_of` and `current_only=False` are
query-time filters over *indexed* rows, so "as_of deliberately brings the
old record back" held only in the window between a correction and the next
consolidation beat — effectively nothing once a region's scheduler or an
agent's own `memory_consolidate` call runs.

`memory.supersede_retention_days` (default `0`, opt-in) keeps a
newly-invalid record's file — and therefore its row — around for that many
days after it stops being current, before consolidation actually archives
it. No new column, no policy change: the *same* `valid_until` predicate that
already hides a superseded record from default (`current_only=True`) results
is what makes it reachable through the window via `as_of` /
`current_only=False`. Only *when* the file leaves the index moves; what a
query sees while it is still there is unchanged.
