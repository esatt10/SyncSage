"""Standalone mode, resumption, tracking, and cold storage.

Rule 7 says every seam owes a test asserting the no-infrastructure path is
unchanged, and this plane adds several: an optional tracking backend, a cold
storage directory, a lease, a background executor. A region with none of those
must behave exactly as it did — which for the tuning plane means "as if it did
not exist", because it is off by default.

The resumption tests are here rather than in `test_tuning_batch.py` because
they are about the *container*, not the batch: a killed process, a `/exports`
that cannot be written, a tracking backend that is not installed.
