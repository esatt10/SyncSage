"""Phase 35.7 — the measured capacity model, and the O(N²) it uncovered.

Half of this file guards a *performance* fix, which is unusual and deliberate.
`replace_artifact_chunks(fresh=True)` skips four DELETEs on the full-sync path
because the source was just emptied. If that assumption is ever wrong the
symptom is not a crash — it is duplicated chunks and duplicated FTS rows,
which show up as a search returning the same document twice and nothing else
noticing. So the tests here assert the *absence* of duplicates rather than
the presence of speed.
