"""The two scaling primitives, replayed identically on both backends.

`tests/test_backend_parity.py` proves the two backends produce the same
*knowledge base* — same ids, same counts, comparable ranking. What it does not
touch is the pair of primitives the fleet is actually built on:

* the **per-source lease** (`sync/locks.py`), which is what lets more than one
  indexer exist without two of them writing one source, and
* the **durable index queue** (`sync/queue.py`), which is what lets a backlog
  survive a restart and a depth be scaled on.

Both are claim protocols. Both turn on the exact things the two dialects
disagree about — `ON CONFLICT … RETURNING`, `UPDATE … RETURNING`, a
conditional `WHERE` re-evaluated under READ COMMITTED, and a `cursor.rowcount`
that one backend used to discard. Every one of those has already produced a
bug here, and two of them produced the *quiet* direction: correct on Postgres,
wrong on SQLite, where the offline suite runs.

So this is a differential test rather than another pair of assertions. A
seeded generator produces one sequence of operations; the sequence is replayed
against both backends; every observable outcome — who won a claim, what a
depth read said, what came back from a queue claim — is recorded in order and
the two transcripts are diffed. A divergence names the operation index it
happened at, which is the thing a reader needs and an equality assertion over
final state cannot give.

Seeded rather than random-per-run: a failure has to be reproducible from the
report alone (pillar 3), and a test that fails on a different sequence each
time is a test nobody can act on. Widening coverage is a matter of adding
seeds to `SEEDS`, which is cheap and explicit.
