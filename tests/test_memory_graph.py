"""Step 33.7 — memory in the knowledge graph.

Acceptance is deliberately **per corpus type**, not in aggregate: an
entity-only bridge passes on a Markdown corpus and is a silent no-op on a
corpus of PDFs or of non-Python code, which is exactly the failure this ladder
exists to avoid. Each case asserts *which rung fired* and that the memory
reaches real corpus content, plus the edge cap, the `supersedes` edges, and
that a region without memory produces an unchanged graph.
