"""PR gate: the config surface must stay reachable and documented.

This replaces ``tests/test_config_wizard_freshness.py``, which guarded a
449-line prose wizard against the schema drifting out from under it. That
wizard is gone, and with it most of the rot it was built to detect: the
interactive wizard reads its defaults off the live dataclasses
(:func:`pheasant.setup_wizard.schema_default`), so a changed default cannot
go stale there.

Two mechanical checks survive, because they are the ones live code cannot
enforce for itself:

1. **Reachability** — every top-level config section is claimed by a
   :class:`~pheasant.setup_wizard.Section`, so a new block cannot be
   unreachable from ``pheasant setup``.
2. **Documentation** — every top-level section is mentioned in
   ``docs/configuration.md``.

Like its predecessor this catches the mechanical failure (a section mentioned
nowhere), not prose accuracy.
