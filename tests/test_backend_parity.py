"""Cross-backend parity for the Phase 35.2 storage seam.

The seam is only worth having if both backends produce the *same knowledge
base*. Three things have to hold, in descending order of how badly a break
would hurt:

1. **Stable IDs are byte-identical.** They are a contract (CLAUDE.md rule 3):
   every persisted graph, every manifest, every Synapse contract references
   them. A backend that changed them would silently orphan existing state.
2. **The same corpus produces the same counts.** Artifacts, chunks, FTS rows,
   graph nodes and edges.
3. **Retrieval quality holds.** This one is deliberately *not* an equality
   assertion. FTS5's ``bm25()`` and Postgres's ``ts_rank_cd`` are different
   functions; demanding identical scores would be demanding something false.
   What matters is that the ranking is as good, so the gate is measured
   quality on a gold set.

These tests need a real Postgres. They skip — loudly, with the reason — when
``PHEASANT_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`` is unset, so the offline suite stays offline and
network-free (CLAUDE.md pillar 3). Point it at a throwaway database:

#: The last case is the one that actually gates the port. The first three have
#: a unique winning token, so they rank correctly whatever the column weights
#: are — mutation testing showed that flattening the ts_rank weights, reversing
#: them, and stripping the title weighting out of the generated tsvector *all*
#: still passed. They only prove the query runs.
#:
#: ``deploy-gateway.md`` is named for the query and barely mentions it; the
#: decoy says "gateway" repeatedly in its body. The right answer wins only
#: because title is weighted above text — which is exactly the 2026-08-03
#: "locate readme" failure (the repo's own README sat at rank 125) that the
#: 8/3/2/1 weights were introduced to fix. If the A/B/C/D mapping is wrong,
#: this case is what says so.

#: The one query the Postgres arm still ranks differently, and why.
#:
#: Three real gaps were found and fixed (see `_postgres_rank_expression` and
#: the schema's tokenizer note): no IDF at all, no term-frequency saturation,
#: and filenames tokenizing as a single lexeme so ``deploy-gateway.md`` never
#: matched "deploy". With those closed, "gateway restarts nightly" — the
#: rare-term case, and the more important retrieval property — is now correct
#: on both backends.
#:
#: What remains is structural, not a parameter. BM25 normalizes each column's
#: contribution by *that column's* length; ``ts_rank_cd`` applies one global
#: normalization to the whole weighted vector. So when a title match on a
#: common term competes with body matches on rare terms, the two rank
#: differently, and no weight vector fixes both cases at once — verified at
#: 8:1, 16:1 and 33:1 title:body ratios, each of which merely moved the
#: failure to the other query.

# declared a `FOREIGN KEY (artifact_id) REFERENCES artifacts(id)` that
# `delete_source_artifacts`/`delete_artifacts` deliberately violate by
# design (they leave a memory's row while deleting its artifact row, to
# preserve earned `uses`/`salience`/`observations` — see those methods'
# docstrings); Postgres enforces that FK and aborted the whole transaction.
# (2) `PostgresBackend.statement()` discarded `cursor.rowcount`, so
# `subsume_records`/`delete_artifacts` raised `AttributeError` the moment
# either ran against a real Postgres connection. (3) `subsume_records`'s
# ledger insert used SQLite-only `INSERT OR IGNORE`, a hard `SyntaxError`
# under Postgres, where the portable form is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ...
# DO NOTHING` (used everywhere else in this codebase already). None of
# these three surfaced in the offline suite, because SQLite never enforces
# a declared FK (no `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` anywhere) and never rejects
# its own `OR IGNORE`/`rowcount` shape. CLAUDE.md rule 10.
