"""The released version, and the container references that must follow it.

Two failure modes live here. One is a generated file drifting off
`pyproject.toml`. The other is subtler and is what these tests were extended
for: a published *reference* — a compose `image:`, a manifest, a `docker run`
line in the README — naming a tag the publish workflow never pushes. Both
surface only as a pull failure on someone else's machine.
