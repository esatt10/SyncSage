"""Phase 35.8 — the graph handoff, named and announced.

The graph is a file on a shared volume: an indexer writes it, every serving
process polls for it, and until now nothing said *which* graph a replica was
answering from. Two consequences, both silent by construction. A replica that
missed a reload served an old graph correctly-looking and forever, and a
retrieval diagnosis could not tell "the document is not indexed" from "this
replica has not picked up the index that has it".

What is asserted here:

1. The generation id is content-addressed, so two replicas agree without
   coordinating and an unchanged graph keeps its name (pillar 1).
2. The publication record is refused when it does not match the graph file's
   own stat tuple — a process killed between the two atomic renames reports
   nothing rather than a label for bytes that were never published.
3. A commit announces itself, exactly once per save, and a broker that fails
   cannot cost the commit.
4. The refresher reloads on the announcement *and* still reloads without one.
   That is the whole design: at-most-once events over a kept poll.
5. `/health` publishes loaded beside published, which is what makes a stale
   replica detectable rather than inferrable.
