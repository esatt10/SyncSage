"""Phase 1 — L0 write-path admission: normalization, reinforcement, ACL.

Acceptance: a write whose *normalized* text matches a live record in the
same (scope, subject, kind, ACL-partition) bucket reinforces that record
(`created=False`, `outcome="reinforced"`, `observations` bumped) instead of
creating a new file — for an exact repeat exactly as for a paraphrase. Two
principals asserting the same sentence at `user`/`session` scope must never
collapse into one record (that would be a cross-principal read through the
write path). `pheasant.memory.normalize` must never fold text with real
argument structure (no token-sort, no stopword removal).
