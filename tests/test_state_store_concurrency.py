"""StateStore reads must be safe AND genuinely concurrent under load.

Regression test for a real bug, and for the fix's own performance cost.

Round 1 (correctness): the agentic assistant workflow runs nested thread
pools (multi_search's per-query pool, containing hybrid.py's per-search-mode
pool), and every search arm (text/vector/graph) reads through
`StateStore.rows()`. The original bug shared one `sqlite3.Connection` across
every thread; without serializing execute()+fetch as one atomic unit,
concurrent queries of DIFFERENT shapes interleaved cursor state and handed
back rows missing expected columns -- reproduced live as
`IndexError: tuple index out of range` from `row["chunk_id"]` inside
vector_store.search(), which silently downgraded the agentic workflow to the
simple one on every request.

The first fix (a global lock around `rows()`) was correct but serialized
every read, which measurably hurt latency: an agentic retrieve step fanning
out 4 queries across 3 search modes went from embarrassingly parallel to
mostly serial (measured live: 22-29s for that step, vs 1.3-2s for a
single-query retrieve doing comparable work). The real fix is a connection
per thread -- SQLite's WAL mode is explicitly designed for concurrent readers
under that pattern -- which removes the shared cursor state instead of
locking around it, so both correctness *and* concurrency hold at once.
